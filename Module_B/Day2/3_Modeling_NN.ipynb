Natural language translation, image recognition, and game playing are all tasks where deep learning models have neared or even exceeded human-level performance.\n\nSo what is deep learning? Deep learning is an approach to machine learning characterized by deep stacks of computations. This depth of computation is what has enabled deep learning models to disentangle the kinds of complex and hierarchical patterns found in the most challenging real-world datasets.\n\nThrough their power and scalability neural networks have become the defining model of deep learning. Neural networks are composed of neurons, where each neuron individually performs only a simple computation. The power of a neural network comes instead from the complexity of the connections these neurons can form.\n\n### The Linear Unit"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"showTitle":false,"cellMetadata":{},"nuid":"f3713a08-40f5-4ee6-9416-6ec862813848","inputWidgets":{},"title":""}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["Image(\"./images/mfOlDR6.png\")"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"showTitle":false,"cellMetadata":{},"nuid":"a0f62220-f24f-4f61-9ef5-f820e38277ec","inputWidgets":{},"title":""}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":0},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["The input is x. Its connection to the neuron has a weight which is w. Whenever a value flows through a connection, you multiply the value by the connection's weight. For the input x, what reaches the neuron is w * x. A neural network \"learns\" by modifying its weights.\n\nThe b is a special kind of weight we call the bias. The bias doesn't have any input data associated with it; instead, we put a 1 in the diagram so that the value that reaches the neuron is just b (since 1 * b = b). The bias enables the neuron to modify the output independently of its inputs.\n\nThe y is the value the neuron ultimately outputs. To get the output, the neuron sums up all the values it receives through its connections. This neuron's activation is \\\\(y = w * x + b\\\\), or as a formula \\\\(y=wx+b\\\\)\n\nDoes the formula \\\\(y=wx+b\\\\( look familiar?\nIt's an equation of a line! It's the slope-intercept equation, where w is the slope and b is the y-intercept. \n\n### The Linear Unit as a Model\n\nThough individual neurons will usually only function as part of a larger network, it's often useful to start with a single neuron model as a baseline. Single neuron models are linear models.\n\nLet's think about how this might work on a dataset like [80 Cereals](https://www.kaggle.com/crawford/80-cereals). Training a model with 'sugars' (grams of sugars per serving) as input and 'calories' (calories per serving) as output, we might find the bias is $b=90$ and the weight is $w=2.5$.

When first created, all of the network's weights are set randomly -- the network doesn't \"know\" anything yet. In this lesson we're going to see how to train a neural network; we're going to see how neural networks learn.\n\nAs with all machine learning tasks, we begin with a set of training data. Each example in the training data consists of some features (the inputs) together with an expected target (the output). Training the network means adjusting its weights in such a way that it can transform the features into the target. In the 80 Cereals dataset, for instance, we want a network that can take each cereal's 'sugar', 'fiber', and 'protein' content and produce a prediction for that cereal's 'calories'. If we can successfully train a network to do that, its weights must represent in some way the relationship between those features and that target as expressed in the training data.\n\nIn addition to the training data, we need two more things:\n\n    A \"loss function\" that measures how good the network's predictions are.\n    An \"optimizer\" that can tell the network how to change its weights.\n\n### The Loss Function\n\nWe've seen how to design an architecture for a network, but we haven't seen how to tell a network what problem to solve. This is the job of the loss function.\n\nThe loss function measures the disparity between the the target's true value and the value the model predicts.\n\nDifferent problems call for different loss functions. We have been looking at regression problems, where the task is to predict some numerical value -- calories in 80 Cereals, rating in Red Wine Quality. Other regression tasks might be predicting the price of a house or the fuel efficiency of a car.\n\nA common loss function for regression problems is the mean absolute error or MAE. For each prediction y_pred, MAE measures the disparity from the true target y_true by an absolute difference abs(y_true - y_pred).\n\nThe total MAE loss on a dataset is the mean of all these absolute differences."],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"showTitle":false,"cellMetadata":{},"nuid":"8fa504c8-7f6a-43bb-9d34-47437083d006","inputWidgets":{},"title":""}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["Image(\"./images/VDcvkZN.png\")"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"showTitle":false,"cellMetadata":{},"nuid":"b05b231c-a30f-4e73-afaf-add71f18ed01","inputWidgets":{},"title":""}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":0},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["The mean absolute error is the average length between the fitted curve and the data points.\n\nBesides MAE, other loss functions you might see for regression problems are the mean-squared error (MSE) or the Huber loss (both available in Keras).\n\nDuring training, the model will use the loss function as a guide for finding the correct values of its weights (lower loss is better). In other words, the loss function tells the network its objective.\nThe Optimizer - Stochastic Gradient Descent\n\nWe've described the problem we want the network to solve, but now we need to say how to solve it. This is the job of the optimizer. The optimizer is an algorithm that adjusts the weights to minimize the loss.\n\nVirtually all of the optimization algorithms used in deep learning belong to a family called stochastic gradient descent. They are iterative algorithms that train a network in steps. One step of training goes like this:\n\n+ Sample some training data and run it through the network to make predictions.\n+ Measure the loss between the predictions and the true values.\n+ Finally, adjust the weights in a direction that makes the loss smaller.\n\nThen just do this over and over until the loss is as small as you like (or until it won't decrease any further.)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/rFI1tIk.gif)"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"showTitle":false,"cellMetadata":{},"nuid":"ba87d736-f77e-4578-be44-9d615e12b01f","inputWidgets":{},"title":""}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Training a neural network with Stochastic Gradient Descent.\n\nEach iteration's sample of training data is called a minibatch (or often just \"batch\"), while a complete round of the training data is called an epoch.

The pale red dots depict the entire training set, while the solid red dots are the minibatches. Every time SGD sees a new minibatch, it will shift the weights (w the slope and b the y-intercept) toward their correct values on that batch. Batch after batch, the line eventually converges to its best fit. You can see that the loss gets smaller as the weights get closer to their true values.\nLearning Rate and Batch Size\n\nNotice that the line only makes a small shift in the direction of each batch (instead of moving all the way). The size of these shifts is determined by the learning rate. A smaller learning rate means the network needs to see more minibatches before its weights converge to their best values.\n\nThe learning rate and the size of the minibatches are the two parameters that have the largest effect on how the SGD training proceeds. Their interaction is often subtle and the right choice for these parameters isn't always obvious. (We'll explore these effects in the exercise.)\n\nFortunately, for most work it won't be necessary to do an extensive hyperparameter search to get satisfactory results. Adam is an SGD algorithm that has an adaptive learning rate that makes it suitable for most problems without any parameter tuning (it is \"self tuning\", in a sense). Adam is a great general-purpose optimizer.\n\n### Adding the Loss and Optimizer\n\nAfter defining a model, you can add a loss function and optimizer with the model's compile method:"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"showTitle":false,"cellMetadata":{},"nuid":"a08ee61a-4b4a-4ba9-8552-258e9e323b07","inputWidgets":{},"title":""}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["model.compile(optimizer=\"adam\", loss=\"mae\",)"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"showTitle":false,"cellMetadata":{},"nuid":"63a6a31c-06bd-49fd-bd67-cd5301afd59b","inputWidgets":{},"title":""}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":0},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Notice that we are able to specify the loss and optimizer with just a string.

The size of the gap tells you how much noise the model has learned.\n\nIdeally, we would create models that learn all of the signal and none of the noise. This will practically never happen. Instead we make a trade. We can get the model to learn more signal at the cost of learning more noise. So long as the trade is in our favor, the validation loss will continue to decrease.

The trick to training deep learning models is finding the best balance between the two.\n\nWe'll look at a couple ways of getting as more signal out of the training data while reducing the amount of noise.\n\n### Capacity\n\nA model's capacity refers to the size and complexity of the patterns it is able to learn. For neural networks, this will largely be determined by how many neurons it has and how they are connected together. If it appears that your network is underfitting the data, you should try increasing its capacity.\n\nYou can increase the capacity of a network either by making it wider (more units to existing layers) or by making it deeper (adding more layers).

Just set your training epochs to some large number (more than you'll need), and early stopping will take care of the rest.\nAdding Early Stopping\n\nIn Keras, we include early stopping in our training through a callback.

To break up these conspiracies, we randomly drop out some fraction of a layer's input units every step of training, making it much harder for the network to learn those spurious patterns in the training data.

The reason is that SGD will shift the network weights in proportion to how large an activation the data produces. Features that tend to produce activations of very different sizes can make for unstable training behavior.\n\nNow, if it's good to normalize the data before it goes into the network, maybe also normalizing inside the network would be better! In fact, we have a special kind of layer that can do this, the batch normalization layer. A batch normalization layer looks at each batch as it comes in, first normalizing the batch with its own mean and standard deviation, and then also putting the data on a new scale with two trainable rescaling parameters. Batchnorm, in effect, performs a kind of coordinated rescaling of its inputs.\n\nMost often, batchnorm is added as an aid to the optimization process (though it can sometimes also help prediction performance). Models with batchnorm tend to need fewer epochs to complete training. Moreover, batchnorm can also fix various problems that can cause the training to get \"stuck\".

Now we're going to apply neural networks to another common machine learning problem: classification. Most everything we've learned up until now still applies. The main difference is in the loss function we use and in what kind of outputs we want the final layer to produce.\n\n### Binary Classification\n\nClassification into one of two classes is a common machine learning problem. You might want to predict whether or not a customer is likely to make a purchase, whether or not a credit card transaction was fraudulent, whether deep space signals show evidence of a new planet, or a medical test evidence of a disease. These are all binary classification problems.\n\nIn your raw data, the classes might be represented by strings like \"Yes\" and \"No\", or \"Dog\" and \"Cat\". Before using this data we'll assign a class label: one class will be 0 and the other will be 1. Assigning numeric labels puts the data in a form a neural network can use.\n\n### Accuracy and Cross-Entropy\n\nAccuracy is one of the many metrics in use for measuring success on a classification problem. Accuracy is the ratio of correct predictions to total predictions: accuracy = number_correct / total. A model that always predicted correctly would have an accuracy score of 1.0. All else being equal, accuracy is a reasonable metric to use whenever the classes in the dataset occur with about the same frequency.\n\nThe problem with accuracy (and most other classification metrics) is that it can't be used as a loss function. SGD needs a loss function that changes smoothly, but accuracy, being a ratio of counts, changes in \"jumps\". So, we have to choose a substitute to act as the loss function. This substitute is the *cross-entropy function*.\n\nNow, recall that the loss function defines the objective of the network during training. With regression, our goal was to minimize the distance between the expected outcome and the predicted outcome. We chose MAE to measure this distance.\n\nFor classification, what we want instead is a distance between probabilities, and this is what cross-entropy provides. Cross-entropy is a sort of measure for the distance from one probability distribution to another."],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"showTitle":false,"cellMetadata":{},"nuid":"fb6cdc31-027a-4a94-8570-8ca10408b488","inputWidgets":{},"title":""}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["Image(\"./images/DwVV9bR.png\")"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"showTitle":false,"cellMetadata":{},"nuid":"b53f507b-71d4-49cd-b206-6b173fdf9876","inputWidgets":{},"title":""}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":0},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["The idea is that we want our network to predict the correct class with probability 1.0. The further away the predicted probability is from 1.0, the greater will be the cross-entropy loss.\n\nThe technical reasons we use cross-entropy are a bit subtle, but the main thing to take away from this section is just this: use cross-entropy for a classification loss; other metrics you might care about (like accuracy) will tend to improve along with it.\n\n### Making Probabilities with the Sigmoid Function\n\nThe cross-entropy and accuracy functions both require probabilities as inputs, meaning, numbers from 0 to 1. To covert the real-valued outputs produced by a dense layer into probabilities, we attach a new kind of activation function, the sigmoid activation."],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"showTitle":false,"cellMetadata":{},"nuid":"e8c245d4-bbea-48a5-ac82-cf012b02bcf4","inputWidgets":{},"title":""}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["Image(\"./images/FYbRvJo.png\")"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"showTitle":false,"cellMetadata":{},"nuid":"8205652e-e661-4189-8998-82313db98a05","inputWidgets":{},"title":""}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":0},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["To get the final class prediction, we define a threshold probability.
