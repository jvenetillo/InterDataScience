My wife also is not into big sound so decided to try out these wireless headphones.  at first i almost sent them back because i took the easy route and hooked them into my receivers headphone jack.  The sound was terrible and there was the dreaded hissing noise you get with some wireless electronics.  before packing them up i decided to hook them up into the jacks on the TV. Difference was like night and day.  the sound quality is great and really brings out some of the background sounds and music that you typically don't notice unless you are in a movie theater.  They aren't super comfortable for long durations but that can be expected with most headphones.  these come fully recommended."],[3.0,"Works good for a boy of 6 and his parents.This game is not really requiring any skills (be it game skills, memory or else).

It has the nice bracket that can mount to your bike and you have it for the road.And although the image here doesn't show it, it does have the gauge, though it isn't the most accurate gauge (not really a problem when the tire is rated for 55 to 100 PSI).Much like one other reviewer noted, the instructions on how to switch from Schrader to Presta are not very clear and should be researched before fumbling with this blasted thing for hours trying to make it work.And like the title mentions, this isn't as tiny as the MINI name implies.  When looking for a place to mount it on my bike, I am really running short on ideas.  The obvious places would interfere with pedaling.All that said, it puts air in the tire.  Slowly.  It is double action, but the throw isn't very much.  And the higher the pressure, the more difficult it is to pump."],[5.0,"Perfect for the gym or under a few layers for the chilly morning runs.

As a result, the ball head is held in place only by the friction of the main screw attachment.

Couldn's be easier... and... the price is right!  Great way to upgrade an older printer!"],[5.0,"I bought this rack to accomodate 2 kids bikes and 2 adult bikes.  I researched bike racks extensively and was relieved when the rack arrived and appeared to be very high quality.  The hardware fittings are oversized, the frame is heavy duty, the padding where the bike frames rest are thick, molded rubber and the velcro straps are about 2inches wide with plenty of length to ensure confidence. There is not a single piece of plastic or cheap material on this bike rack.  It took about 30 minutes to assemble the rack and get it ready for hitch installation.  One glitch I found was that the threads on my rack were reversed.  While the instructions said to screw the bolt from the passenger side through the hitch, mine was clearly too loose after installation.  The rack needs to screw in TIGHT into the hitch.  Luckily I tried to screw it from the drivers side and it worked just fine.  There is minimal clearance between the two pieces once the rack is fully installed.  There is a heavy duty pin that allows for tilting the rack to access the trunk.Now the fun part begins.  Make no mistake, the first time you try to mount your bikes, plan for 45 minutes!  This is a game of Tetris, but once you figure out the right configuration for your bikes, the mounting should take no more than 10 minutes including straps. We ended up putting the 2 kids bikes first then the 2 adult bikes. (yes the kids bikes Require an extension bar.) Keep in mind, there will always be points where the bikes rub together, but you can minimize touch points by moving the pedals to the optimal position.  After that, we used knee and elbow pads as padding between the bikes.  This works like a charm!  The velcro straps allow for a variety of secure positions and we haven't scratched our bikes at all!The last part of securing the bikes includes straps.  It is recommened to strap any bike that uses an extension bar from the bike frame or tire to the bike rack directly.  This provides extra security should the extension bar fail, the bikes will still be strapped to the bike rack.  I usually wrap one long strap around the first pair of bikes securing them to the rack, and attach another strap to the second pair of bikes and rack.  The last strap I use is secured from the bike rack to the roof rack of my SUV.  This is actually a critical part of feeling secure!  This is an anti-sway strap that keeps the entire bike rack from moving too much when you hit a bump in the road or go over a train track.  Trust me, you want to buy this strap!Our first road trip with the bikes fully loaded took us across 4 hours of highway and country roads.  The bikes arrived without a scratch and my nerves were intact too.  We have used the rack now 10+ times and each time it gets easier.  Overall, I highly recommend this bike rack.  It is a very strong and sturdy extension of your vehicle.  The only drawback I see is that it doesn't fold down.  But the single post allows me to mount kids bikes, the tilt function is perfect and easy to use, the strength in design is obvious so I will accept the single drawback happily!"],[1.0,"This vacuum is one of the worst vacuums I have ever purchased. The premise behind it is great, but the longevity and performance of this vacuum need vast improvement before the product is brought into the market.In addition to poor suction, you have a motor that loses a charge faster than anything I've ever owned (which includes the very first rechargable batteries and you remember how horrible those were)"],[5.0,"We had a chair like this when I was a kid, only it was yellow.

I haven't had any issues sending or receiving messages and phone calls, and it's done everything I need it to do... just not as smoothly as I think it should. I decided to write a review from the perspective of someone who has had the phone long enough to know the bugs.The touch screen worked well for the first month or two, and I finally began to get used to texting on it. Unfortunately over time the phone has become less and less responsive. (And I am not hard on electronics) It still works with a little extra pressure, but this can become frustrating. The touch sensitivity is not 100% accurate either. You'd think after a year I would be used to texting on the number keypad, but the phone frequently thinks I'm typing a key across the screen. Unfortunately, it often thinks I'm hitting the clear button when my finger is a few buttons away. Also, the phone has difficulty sensing touch in some of the menus. I can push a button 10 different ways and it still won't open sometimes.I love Tracfone, and this phone has served its purpose, but I would not recommend it. I finally am getting so fed up with trying to push buttons and navigate menus that I'm getting a different Tracfone without a touch screen.What I do love about this phone is the speaker quality for both calls and the music player. I've also had very few issues with it unlocking in my pocket and making calls. The battery life is phenomenal and will last me five days to a week with moderate usage.If you're going Tracfone (which I recommend because it is so much cheaper than everyone else!) I would suggest avoiding touch screens because they are not quite up to the standard responsiveness that we are used to. If you want a lesson in patience though, this is the way to go. ;)"],[4.0,"Could this possibley be the future, is cloning that far away.

The Tapes have the Issue of not overlapping exactly perfectly at times, exposing the Adhesive of the Labels which can collect Debris. The Printing, occasionally, has \"drop outs\" where parts of the information are missing. Again, typical of this line of Labelers and Tapes. The Tapes can get dirty if you are not careful, so keep them in the Case when not loaded into the Labeler. I read in another Review about lack of room in the Case for Tapes. I found enough room for one of each size Tape. That's all I need. Of course, the Labeler has one Tape loaded, too. The Power Adaptor is nice as a Back Up and I've used it that way a few times, but mostly I just run on Batteries. Large Labels with Large Bold Lettering also benefit from using the Power Adaptor. I'm considering cutting the Top of the Case Off to make it easier to maneuver and use, and then using Velcro to hold it back on for Storage. A Removable Lid would have been a nice touch."],[4.0,"There are lighter alternatives for water purification, but iodine is not recommended for people like me with thyroid disease, and this filter is still relatively lightweight, easy to use, and easy to share.  Water moves both while pumping up and down, and the action is smooth and easy.  I have used this at 3 different backcountry water sources so far without getting sick.The main drawback is that it's a little clumsy to both work the pump and balance the container, and I've accidentally dropped a water bottle into a creek.  It includes connectors for connecting directly to a hydration bladder, but it expects 1/4\" inner diameter tubing, and all the bladders I have found use larger diameter.  I finally found this bladder which has tubing too large, but has compatible connectors that I can make work with some extra tubing from the hardware store.  I'll be trying it out on my next trip in a couple weeks, and hopefully that will help with the clumsiness issue.  If anyone knows a better bladder to use, please leave a comment.Just a quick warning about the moral hazard of using gear like this.  When you can filter as much water as you want, it's easy to think you're safe and abandon a little caution.  I had to backtrack a half mile on my last trip because a water source I was aiming for turned out to be dried up for the season, but I passed up a perfectly good source because I still had a little water left.  A half mile isn't a big deal, but it could have been a lot worse if the distance had been longer."],[5.0,"We got this so we could whip eggs into stiff peaks without getting the mixer out for 2 or 3 eggs.

I love the smell."],[5.0,"Primary reason I bought these is because I was looking for comfort and quality in an affordable price range, $100-$150.  Bought these for a little over $100 and have hardly taken them off since.  Comfort is a 10/10.  I can wear these literally all day and not have a headache or earache.  The only time I'm bothered is with wearing glasses, and only that after 12+ hours of wearing these nonstop.  Even then it's not bad.  I often find myself wearing these without even listening to anything, they're that comfortable.As for quality, I mostly use these for playing games and listening to music.  They sound really good with a higher volume with a good balance.  They do have an open sound, which means sound leaks out rather significantly at high volumes but you don't have an &#34;inside your own head&#34; feeling like with closed headphones, so overall a positive.  I wouldn't use these out and about but I don't think I'd wear anything but earbuds outside anyway.  Quality is very good for music, hard to judge for studio use since I just don't have as much experience with higher-end headphones since I can't afford them.  However, from the studio headphones I have used, these are at least on par and will get the job done very well.  The open &#34;leaking&#34; would be my main concern for recording using a mic, but it is easily solved by keeping the volume reasonable.Overall, very happy with my purchase and the next pair of headphones I get would be another just like these unless I have the money for something top-of-the-line."],[1.0,"I used this product to help me fight bad breath and control tartar and even fight gingivitiswell to my disappointment this has actually made my mouth worse and created a new problem, white film is peeling from my cheeksalso the tastes is awful"],[1.0,"After many tries this item would only work about 1 in 5 tries.

Now, I had enjoyed this the first time I viewed it (holy cow, can it really be 15 years ago? I'm feeling old...), but I'm well aware that it's long been fashionable in some circles to make fun of the film. But you know, I don't think it really deserves it.Oh, there's no doubt the star of the film is the ship; the screenplay itself is less than stellar. It's a bit hokey and clunky and heavy-handed, with no real subtlety or originality. But in one sense, these attributes actually work well with a story set in this era; the simple plot (with a broad portrayal of both good and evil characters) is presented in a fashion similar to how a melodrama would have been depicted back in 1912, whether on-stage or in the earliest short silent films. I found myself thinking that the script really wasn't nearly as bad as many people have made it out to be, over the intervening years since the film was first released.That said, I'm afraid that the film didn't really \"grab\" me as much this time around, as it had when I first saw it when I was a good deal younger. Maybe I'm just getting old and tired and cynical? Or, perhaps it's the fact that I'm not a big fan of any of the actors in the film, and have no interest whatsoever in the two playing the leads. I think if the film featured some acting talent about whom I was enthusiastic, who I was excited to see on the screen, I would have found the film to be considerably more riveting. As it is---eh, I'm not all that thrilled with any of the characters apart from Molly Brown, who I thought was a lot of fun in every one of her too-brief scenes.Hmmm, what can I say---I still enjoy the picture (though it's not one that I'm likely to re-watch often in its entirety) and I do recommend it. However---any film with a running time of over three hours needs to have an intermission! Sitting still that long is too hard on the butt---heh.The 3D conversion was nicely done, but not exceptional. I thought it would be a little more striking, in fact---after the first hour I kind of forgot that I was even seeing it in 3D. But, no real complaints on this score.This re-release may not set any box-office records, but after only a week in theatres it's already easily paid for the 3D conversion process and is making a tidy profit.---SLIGHT SPOILER WARNING---Oh, I do have one huge complaint---and there's probably no need to even post spoiler warnings, because doesn't everyone already know exactly what happens at the end? While I find the very end of the film most touching---haunting, even---the bit that comes before that annoys the heck out of me. I STILL am ticked off that \"old Rose\" threw the priceless blue diamond into the water! I don't care how symbolic it is---explain it any way you like, that was just a stupid and pointless and senseless thing to do to an art object that had huge historical significance. Holy cow, she could have just written out a complete account of her story and packed it up along with the gem---and then upon her death made sure her will specified that the package was delivered to the Smithsonian, or something like that. Man---even writing out these words, and I find I'm getting ticked off all over again! So, that's the one thing that I really hate about this film.Well, now that I'm thinking about the ship, I'm curious to view both the 1950's version ofTitanic(starring Barbara Stanwyck) andA Night to Remember (Criterion Collection)(also from the 1950's). I've seen both films, but it's been a while and I don't have a clear recollection of either..."],[5.0,"Now everybody gets an even sized wedge.Fast and easy eight section wedger.Might even work with tangerines too.Would definitely recommend."],[5.0,"Nicer than I expected.

GREAT GREAT product!!!!"],[3.0,"For all those giving this movie 1-2 star ratings, please understand the serious problems involved in making this thing.  The film was originally scheduled for a 2002 release but it suffered from production and serious financial problems -- the company went bankrupt during post-production. I'm guessing they HAD to slap together something and get it released to make enough money just to pay off all the lawyers.The \"cheesy\" CGI was of the quality found in big-budget TV sci-fi shows of that time (like Star Trek Voyager). The post-production team probably could not afford to buy high-end \"Jurassic Park\" type CGI for a B-movie. The CGI renditions they used are passable on a TV-size screen but come off as absolutely horrid on a 40 foot screen. I suspect this is why much of the film was shot in low-light environments -- don't have to show as much detail.As noted by many, the film also suffered from terrible scripting; don't blame the actors, they have to work with what's placed in front of them.Remember, the movie was based on a Ray Bradbury sci-fi short story written in the 1950's -- long before much was known about how dinosaurs became extinct, or the fact that the Earth suffered numerous mass-extinctions throughout its history. The whole \"butterfly effect\" is absurdly ridiculous especially given the fact the plot has a pyroclastic flow from an erupting volcano wiping out all the local life anyway. Nor can we ignore the giant comet / meteor that wiped out some 90% of all life on the planet 65-million years ago (that probably was not known as a scientific fact when Bradbury wrote the story).Did it ever occur to anyone that maybe the butterfly was SUPPOSED to die and that the \"time-wave\" events depicted in the movie ,in fact, showed the correct version of evolution? Maybe it was Homo Sapiens (and all other primates) who shouldn't be here today? Maybe it was the highly-evolved simian-reptiles who actually made the first journey back to the Jurassic tar-pit and THEY were the ones who screwed everything up in the first place?Never the less, I gave the movie a charitable 3-star rating. Suitable for kids cooped up in the house on a rainy Saturday afternoon or a dorm room beer party. Cheap entertainment, just avoid thinking while viewing and you'll be o.k.

Unlike the other customers, I bought this telescope at a local store with a 2-year warranty. Thus, the telescope was unbroken and packaged properly. The instruction manual was detailed and the telescope came with a software known as theSky, which is a useful program that allows you to locate celestial bodies at the place and time which you are at.The telescope itself is a sturdy unit, and was properly collimated. With its 127mm aperture, I could easily view planets, stars, and also the moon with great ease. The telescope mount is german equatorial, which was useful as it allows you to track down the star you want to find in the night sky by countering the earth's rotation. As this type of mounting also causes the telescope to move in a slow motion, it is easier to pinpoint a star as compared to an alt-azimuth mount."],[3.0,"The hardware works very well, and the fact that it's solid-state is a huge bonus since my drive get's a lot of travel time. The battery life is great! Oh, did I mention that it has a battery?!? The problem lies in the software. If Toshiba put half as much time into developing the software as they did the hardware, this would be an amazing portable drive. The Android app simply does not work for me (Samsung Note 3). It crashes each time I try to use it, so I could not even test it to see what kinds of features it has. The PC interface is not great, but it works. I really hope Toshiba spends some time fixing the software-side of this product, because if/when they do it will be absolutely worth having."],[5.0,"I received this product complementary from Influenster and absolutely love these pens!

I ordered this when my wrist pain was at its worst, due to my continual typing day in and day out.  When the item came, it looked a little smaller than I expected, but it fit my wrist comfortably.  This being small actually turned out to be an advantage; I could easily remove it when I'm not typing and stash it into my pocket until I need it again.After about few weeks of use, my wrist pain subsided substantially.  And I've been using this for almost a year now, and the pain is completely gone!The only issue with this is that, after many days of use, it starts picking up bad oder.

I first tried Nizoral 1% shampoo but it did nothing for me.  Then I tried Neutrogena T-Gel and it didn't do enough.  T-Sal is the strongest medicinal shampoo you can buy for scalp dermatitis that I know of.  You must use a lot of the shampoo and lather it up and leave it on your scalp for at least 5 minutes for maximum benefit.  Also do not forget to also use the shampoo around your ears, your neck and your forehead as the skin there may also be affected by the dermatitis.  I bought the 5 bottle package and I have already used the first bottle in little over a month.  I plan to continue to use this shampoo as I have noticed an improvement in my scalp problems.  This shampoo is only for those who suffer from seborrhea and psoriasis of the scalp and other dermatitis.  You do not need it for regular dandruff.  If you have normal dandruff, get Head and Shoulders.  T-Sal is for more than just dandruff.  I use a Pantene anti-breakage conditioner after I use this shampoo.

Life and kids has regulated me to digital cameras of the point and shoot variety until now. I did tons of research online, consulted with several Photography types, and came up with the FujiFilm X series. I settled on the X-E1 over the X-M1 for the viewfinder and not the X-Pro1 due to size and cost.This camera is the most pleasant to operate of any camera I have seen since cameras went digital. You want to set Aperture? Roll the ring on the lens, just like you did with a film camera. Shutter speed? Dial on top again like a film camera. There are no 'Mode' dials anywhere to be found, on 'Sports, Mountain, Birthday cake settings' . just plain simple controls. If you want the shutter speed to be automatic, set it to A, same with Aperture.If you want more, there are tons of options in the menu system, but most photo enthusiasts will just ignore these.The image sensor is fantastic, providing image quality on par with the very best DSLR's out there, even full frame. Within 30 minutes of owning the X-E1, I took the best pictures I ever have, and even more important my wife was able to reproduce the same results. A lot of this was also due to the 35mm f1.4 lens, but the simplicity of the camera and it's high quality sensor round out the picture.The build quality is top notch, with all the dials and buttons having great feel and positive feedback.The owners manual is a bit small so I downloaded the .pdf from Fuji's web site and loaded it into iBooks, now I just read it on the iPad, so size problem solved.This will be, I believe, my camera of choice for many years to come."],[4.0,"You never really appreciate these things until you try them. Sitting in bed reading, it is difficult finding a comfortable position for my legs. One ankle on top of the other knee... straight out... both bent...just wasn't working. Using one of these in physical therapy, I found it highly comfortable and my legs weren't at all restless like they are in the sitting on a flat bed position. This particular wedge has three different angles/heights you can use. I don't see how anyone would say that it is too big, unless they are a &#34;small person&#34;... like 3' high. The shortest height/angle is only about 9&#34; high. I use the short side on my upper legs and the long side for my lower legs (opposite of the photo above). I am medium height but have a long torso and short legs for my height. It is only about 2&#34; wide, so it is not this &#34;huge&#34; thing on my bed. This is really going to help with my back and leg comfort as well.

Great product!"],[2.0,"This is a great DVD transfer of the non-stop special effects of Alien vs Predator (AVP). Enjoying even the great special effects of this film isn't enough to make for a really memorable sci-fi experience as it takes an engaging plot to make a good film, even in science-fiction.I don't believe anyone would think of this movie as part of the Alien series or try to compare it with prior Alien films. It obviously represents a \"knock off\" intended to attract from a large number of satisfied customers of the Alien vs Predator magazines. This doesn't mean that it shouldn't be considered good sci-fi film and I purchased the DVD hoping for a satisfying film experience.The story line does a nice job of connecting the film histories of the Alien and Predator races together and linking these two fictional accounts with the history of man on earth in a plausible way. Most people agree that the history of ancient monuments all over the earth appear to have a common link, which is probably one of the sources of the Atlantis myth.If anything I think AVP attempted to recapture the action and line up of good characters from ALIENS. Also, rather than the one-on-one bug hunt of the original film, this movie was about war between a defacto army of humans against an army of Alien creatures and their very dangerous Queen.In terms of special effects I would give this movie four stars, however, I couldn't get all that interested in the basic story and AVP left me with an overall one to two star impression and the feeling I was watching an animated comic book.I must admit that I never had the large screen theater experience and first saw the film on DVD at home. I assumed I would at least like AVP since I own the entire Alien series on DVD and enjoy seeing every one of them over and over again. However, I did find it worth watching and am looking forward to purchasing \"Alien vs Predator Requiem\""],[4.0,"Build is very cheap but it needs to be so there is not a ton of extra weight on the camera.

No luck yet."],[5.0,"Flaws and all, this is one classic film, something for the time capsule. It's got it ALL, baby.Let's start with Rob Lowe. Jerry McGuire he ain't. You're never going to see Rob with tears streaming down his cheeks, telling a woman that she \"completes\" him. Rather, you're more likely to find him yanking his clothes out of the closet, pulling out any photos that include him, stuffing it all in a duffel bag and hurling it into a garbage truck as he leaves the former object of his desire alone and naked in bed...just like the opening minutes of \"Bad Influence.\"And yes, I know Rob has taken some \"serious\" roles and has played the \"good guy\" on occasion, but my challenge to you is \"NAME one of those roles.\" I remembered them at the time, and I've forgotten them, pretty much like every other Rob Lowe fan on the planet. We want Evil Rob, and this movie is Pure Evil Rob.I won't offer any spoilers here, but let's just say that if you can't see the major plot twist coming from a mile away, you haven't seen too many movies.James Spader seems like an odd choice to play Lowe's \"good\" doppelganger, the guy who becomes corrupted as Rob introduces him to his own wants and desires. Spader's starred in more than his fair share of \"this guy makes me feel kind of squirmy\" roles. Of course, the only way the corruption of the character's \"innocence\" can appear real is that if it's built on shaky foundations to begin with, and Spader nails it. His character is a \"career guy,\" a \"ladder climber,\" engaged to Marcia Cross, who equally nails the boring, white bread, \"why am I marrying this woman\" object of Spader's luke-warm desire. See, Spader really doesn't want the pot of gold at the end of his rainbow. He wants to ride around in  sporty little car with Evil Rob Lowe and do evil things. And he does. Why do you think the movie is named \"Bad Influence\" instead of \"Two Nice Guys Helping Others?\"The soundtrack is lip-smackin' 80s dee-licious, too. Lots of synthy angst...a highlight being The Nymphs performing \"The Highway\" during Lowe and Spader's first venture into one of the sleazy \"password at the door\" clubs. According to the notes on the YouTube clip of this scene, \"Inger Lorre wrote this song about Richard Ramirez, the \"Night Stalker,\" and the groupies he attracted during his trial.\" Makes it a perfect choice for this movie.I could go on...in detail...but I'm keeping my \"no spoilers\" promise. You probably have a general idea of what this one is all about, and I've tried to convey the flavor without ruining the experience. I love it, I've watched it at least 100 times since its release...it's a \"midnight movie,\" it's sublime junk, it's a career high for Lowe. He plays his character with such oily, unrepentant glee that you envy anyone having that much fun and getting paid for it. BUY THIS ONE NOW!"],[5.0,"Actually this was for my grand daughter.

This is one of the foods I rotate through. The tank gets about two large pinches when I feed, and they get this particular food about once a week (I also feed brine shrimp, flake, blood worms, algae wafers and more).The fish gobble this up quickly. I have never seen a shrimp be able to eat one before all the guppies hoover the little pellets up. The pellets/pieces are medium sized... a bit too big for fry under 2-3 weeks old.The container label lists the ingredients as: \"Fish meal, krill, corn meal, squid meal, wheat flour, earthworm meal, dried spirulina algae, wheat gluten meal, dried seaweed meal, dried yeast, squid liver meal, dicalcium phosphate, calcium carbonate, dried mango...\" it goes on for awhile. I'm not entirely happy about seeing so much grain in the food mix. The container also says to feed as much in a day as the shrimp can eat in 2 hours.The expiration date is for 6/14. Being that I bought this about two months ago, it has roughly a 2 year shelf life. Good enough.All in all, I might not buy this again. The guy I bought my shrimp from said to just give them algae wafers every so often, and a bit of scallop once in a while as a treat. I don't think the shrimp will miss this. The guppies probably won't either. If I was keeping only shrimp I would buy it again, just to give the little guys some variety in their diet."],[3.0,"This air hose is a very good product at a good price...A little stiff on recoil but very functional...I am satisfied with it's performance..."],[5.0,"IT WAS A PERFECT MATCH FOR MY CAR.

I took off the wrapper and ever so gently put it in my mouth. I loved the taste!This gum has a green and silver package, also a silver wrapper. This gum has a very good texture; it is soft, actually chewable and delicious! As most already know this gum, as well as most gum, makes your breath smell good. Also it curves your hunger! It is also is very kid-friendly, great for the little ones.I love the flavor of this gum. Sweet mint is so delectable. Also I love this gum because it smells appetizing. I love how this gum last a long time. Another good thing about this gum is that it is sugar-free. This gum also lasts for around twenty minutes. This gum taste like ice-cream, but less cold. I love almost everything about this gum.Remember how I said ALMOST, the only thing I detest is how fast the flavor runs out after twenty minutes. That is just not long enough for me. It is better than nothing. Your spit affects your outcome. I mostly love this product!Kids love this, adults too! Gum chewers of all ages will love the sweetness of mint. People who seek flavor will seek this product. Mint lovers will fall in love. Ice-cream cravers who don't like the cold will crave this gum.

I think it is pretty cool.You can't turn furby off but you can put him to sleep. Put furby to sleep by leaving him in a dark room unattended for two minutes. Feed furby by putting your finger in his mouth and pushing on his tongue or you can feed him with the furby app.It is best to put rechargeable batteries in furby because he uses them quickly.All furbys are for ages 5 years and up. But some furbys might be better for younger children as furbys are all different colours and textures. For example, a white furby might be better for a young child and a black one for an older child because white furbys have longer fur and also they look a little different than black furbys.Furbys can change their personality suddenly. They might be a rock star personality and then they might close their eyes and move them quickly so it looks kind of like they are having a seizure and start saying '' me change '' and when they open their eyes and they are a valley girl!!!!!Furbys are AMAZING toys overall though."],[1.0,"This drive arrived dead on arrival - not even a hum ...

Every once in a while, when the itch to \"live large\" needs a scratch, hey, get the band back together and hit the road for another \"greatest hits\" tour, supporting another \"greatest hits\" album.Well, all was fine and good until digital media upset the Apple cart. Now with the kids sharing their Bit-Torrent files across the web in their iTunes programs, nobody's selling units anymore. And every pimply teen with an iPad has every greatest hits compilation you could ever make. Now the only time the gravy train rolls into the station for elderly and burned out artists is a new tour. Watching these codgers drag themselves across the stage at your local highly-flammible nightclub borders on the inhumane. Instead of treasuring the music of your childhood, now you have to see it fumbled out from the arthritic fingers of your idols of yesteryear.This is all to give a little background to the sad story of REM and their latest merchandising play. While branching out like this is an ingenious way to avoid leaving the house (getting prescription refills for your hypertension and high cholesterol is such a pain on tour! And forget about dealing with the insurance coverage), I have to say that branding a nose hair remover with the previously solid \"Alternative\" brand of REM might have been a mis-step. I am sure that the band members love the product (when you get old, hair comes out of your nose, ears and other unexpected holes) but maybe they could have held out for a classier product- I mean, even that rapist Vince guy has the Slap Chop.Anyway, I'm sure the REM Nose Hair Pulling Spring is great; but don't expect it to bring you back to the magic teen years like listening to \"Document\" does."],[5.0,"This is an amazing case!

While some newer cars have something like this built in, it's great for older cars and would be ideal for an RV or trailer to prevent any issues on a long trip. The car on which I've used the system has steel valve stems, so I haven't had any issues with losing air pressure or damage to the valves.The thing I liked the least was the installation. There is no way I could have figured out how to install the system from the documentation supplied. I had to get help from someone who is very familiar with the set up of electronics, such as navigation systems, and even he had to muddle through to figure out how to complete the set up due to the poor documentation. One issue we had is that one of the tires we wanted to monitor was already low in pressure and the system wouldn't pick that tire up during the set up.I like the design of the system itself. The monitor can be closed while driving, and then the driver only needs to worry about it if the green light changes to yellow or red. When the car is stopped, the screen can be reviewed to view the details on whatever problem is being detected. In addition, the monitor will sound an alarm for any of the \"red\" warnings.I have found it to be a useful system and would definitely find it useful for an RV or if hauling a trailer.

I'm not an audiophile and don't have a Technics 1200 to compare it to, but I do have ears and eyes and hands.  First of all, this unit looks good.  I may be biased because I've wanted a new turntable for over a year and I chose the AT-LP120 very early on in my research, but it does look nice.  I have a couple of friends that DO have the 1200MK2, and they like this turntable.  One of them purchased a 120 to use every day and... because it has the USB out.  He calls it a 1200 clone.  Second, if you pick it up, you'll feel the substantial weight which undoubtably lends to it's steadiness and (so far) unwaivering spin rate.  My old turntable, a Technic SA-202 I've had since 1982, has served me well and still serves as the party starter in the garage (next to the bar and milk crates full of records).  Had to move it down there when the other TT crapped out over 5 years ago, so you can see I really needed a new living room unit.  And of course sound wise, the new AT-LP120 does not dissapoint.  But again, maybe my opinion is biased, because I just love to play an album.  I like sliding out the liner, then the record, smell of the vinyl, slight static that raises the hair on my arms, using the discwasher, then placing the arm manually and hearing that &#34;thump&#34; as the needle settles into the groove.  Then sitting back and listening to a whole side, where I'm not clamoring to find a new song or jumping ahead with a touch screen &#34;click&#34;, is much more enjoyable. You could buy this turntable because it's a good deal, really, for what I paid for the 202 in 1982 (just over $200) you can have a greatly superior model.  But if you're like me, you'll buy it for the experience, it can't be beat."],[5.0,"I have used this brand for several years and highly recommend them.

A burnt out junkie who is closer to the end of his career than the beginning seems to fit him perfectly.This movie is a heist movie to begin with, and director Neil Jordan shoots it with the appropriate glitz and glamour that a film set in Monte Carlo deserves. He nails the atmosphere, giving the movie a dark, jazzy feel, mixing the styles of the classic films noir and the new reinvention of the style. The plot is good, as it is filled with twists and turns, as any good heist flick should. One thing that should be mentioned is the chemistry between all the characters. The cast is completely European, save Nolte, yet they mesh incredibly well together. The relationship between Bob and Roger the police officer is one of the movie's centerpieces, and their mutual respect and odd friendship is completely believable without too much explanation. Also good in this movie is the girl who plays Anna, and I won't even attempt to spell her name, because it could take up to an hour to get it right. She is as throaty as she is innocent, yet there is an obvious dark side to her character, one that often shines brighter than the innocence of a seventeen year old runaway.Aside from the crime side of the movie, &quot;The Good Thief&quot; is about rebirth, in all of the characters. They are all ressurecting themselves from their past lives, trying to make good on the lives that still lay ahead of them. All in all, this is a good movie, and should entertain most people who are into this genre until the exciting end."],[5.0,"I am using this on my new sirius satellite radio, and I got what I was expecting and works great!!!"],[4.0,"This carafe has been a great addition to my home.

Just like the one I had when I was 7, only much better!!  The detail is amazing.  No dumb battery compartments for the \"lights and sound\" features--because there aren't any.  The panels pop off for battle damage and have, so far, stayed on when I wanted them to.  The old one I had would blow the panels off after enough playtime and would really bother me after a while because you would just set the thing down and the panels would pop off.  Man, I hated that!!  This one doesn't seem to have that problem yet.  The color of the ship is nice and the price isn't TOO bad where you couldn't buy 2 or 3 to have a nice, little fleet.  I think you do NOT have to buy the X-wing to go with this because the Red Leader X-wing fighter is a much better toy to buy.  The detail is way better and it just looks better.  These classic Star Wars ships are loads of fun and can stand the test of time.  I loved them 30 years ago and my kids love them now."],[5.0,"Keeping in mind I've been a licensed A&P mechanic during my entire working life and I'm fairly smart, I found the assembly easy and well engineered however, some may not. I was able to make certain assumptions and observations because of my background and had no difficulty putting things together. The finish is durable and resists everything I've done to it so far.. Design and placement of drawers, shelves, etc. works good for me. Packaging was well thought out too. Even if you're not mechanically inclined, by taking your time, fitting panels and lining up holes before you do any changing, things go together as advertised...at least mine did.  It is the best assembly required computer desk I've ever had.

I had one that came in a student nurse pack that literally probably cost about $5. I never knew why everyone fussed over them when I could hear just fine.

I hardly have to concentrate and listen now because this stethoscope delivers sound amazingly. The color selection is also great!"],[4.0,"The colors in this palette are so perfect.  The only issue I have with it is that the black eyeshadow gets mixed up w/ the base and I end up having to wipe off a lot of base with a tissue or qtip before I can use it, because it gets mixed up in there.I think the quality of the makeup is quite good.  When I put it on exactly how Lauren does in her youtube video, it lasts all day!I really love it for travel, though.  All I have to take now is foundation, mascara, some loose powder, and this!

The challenge was it's not currently available in Australia - but easy to obtain online.I've been using the product for just over a month and can see a world of difference.  It's specifically designed for coloured hair that has been treated for long periods of time.

Just plug it in, set your preferences, and you immediately get an image.  The camera lens needs to be focused manually, which is a little tricky but does allow the use of a less wide angle lens.  The quality of the image is ok - not as crisp as that of the built-in powerbook cameras. The color accuracy varied considerably between the two computers I tried with it.  Coupled with iGlasses software, I was able to get a fairly acceptable palate on both machines. The built-in microphone seemed to work well.  Overall, it is an acceptable camera at about $30, and fills a void for Mac users, who need a camera a low cost."],[5.0,"Couldn't find the right shade of this produce for my skin tone in the stores.

As long as you wet the suction cup and push it down firmly, it holds very well. My son can pull it off when he is determined. But I am always sitting next to him when he is playing. It does a good job of keeping him entertained and distracted at meals so I can have some adult conversation."],[5.0,"I bought these adapter plugs because I was going to Europe from America and I wanted to be able to plug stuff in.  By &#34;stuff,&#34; I mean my laptop, my electric shaver, my iPhone charger, and a 1980s boombox that I travel with at all times just to keep things chill and fresh.  My goal was to be able to plug things in while in Germany--but also while in the Netherlands.  And I was successful.  Are there other adapters out there that can do the same thing?  Probably.  Are they cheaper?  Maybe--but these were under $7.

Anyway, the bottom line was would they eat it. Resounding yes! Rip, the old boy, bolted his down (one of the reasons I like small nuggets) and then was snacking out of the bag until I closed it, at which point he lay down right by the bag. That was a couple of bags ago and they continue to eat it happily.

I have had gluten free pizza one other time at a pizza joint and thought I couldn't make something as delicious at home. The dough was easier to work with than I expected. It only rises a little bit and instead of cutting it in two I made one large 16&#34; pizza. Just make sure to spray down your pizza pan with pam or similar type spray and get a bowl of warm water to keep your hands wet so the dough is easier to work with. I followed the instructions to a &#34;T&#34; (other than adding seasoning to the crust before the initial cooking to make it more flavorful) and ended up with an amazing gluten free pizza even my picky husband loved! It doesn't taste like the typical greasy pizza hut type pizza but if you enjoy gluten free pizza you will love this! I will be buying more at this price soon, it's way cheaper than order out and much better for you."],[3.0,"The belt is ok...the attachments are fairly worthless.  The radio holster is a complete and total waste of material, not holding the radio in place at all!

I scratched constantly, I even took Humira which did not help.  One washing and I could tell the difference immediately.  I only wash my hair 2-3 times per week and my scalp is great.  I do have one pesky spot, just a little longer with the shampoo and it clears up."],[2.0,"The stars are nice quality and although it's a pain to have to individually put putty on each one before sticking them on the ceiling, they stick well and don't fall off.

My only question is if the gas shock will hold up over time, but usually that is not a problem with other chairs that do not fasten the same way as this one that has pockets to hold the shock, rather than just a simple hole in the wheel section and seat section.  The chair fits well, and so far is holding up well and appears to be solid.  I was worried about the seat between the armrests, but they are a little adjustable, about two or three inches on each arm.  I am considering ordering another chair just like this one."],[5.0,"These bottles are great, we also got the large ones as well. They warm easily, are easy to wash and sterilize.

I had Braun (model 6520), which I got for my 18th birthday, and it lasted me almost 8 years. Throughout the 8 years, I changed foil only once. The old model gave me a shave whose closeness was competitive to manual razors.Finally I decided to get this new model. While it's not perfect, it comes very close to it. It gives a closer shave than my older model, provides a softer feel while shaving and does it faster. It still leaves room for improvement, such as providing a better shave in the neck area, but its performance is still much improved over older models.I cannot say that I shaved with many good manual razors, like Mach III or others, the ones I did shave with, didn't actually provide a better shave than this electric model. Of course the big plus with electric is that it  doesn't cut my skin like razors do. Moreover, it's faster and without any mess.It should be noted that face should be dry prior to shaving, or else shave will not be nearly as close. All in all, it's a great product in terms of performance, reliability and comfort."],[5.0,"We exchanged 3 regular 100 watt light bulbs down the center of our garage with 12 foot ceilings, and what a great difference these bulbs make.

More specifically I bought this product to help with my coarse roots and edges smooth in between relaxing. I give this flat iron a 4 star rating because it does get very hot and did work well to tame my edges and roots.The only reason I gave the four star rating is because this product should be redesigned to include teeth for combing as you flat iron as well as thinner, flatter arms so for a closer, optimal root straightening. Other than that this is a great product."],[4.0,"The tool is very good in term of durability.  However, the accessory the came with the tool is crappy.  The bi-metal blade barely cut two nails and then refuse to work.  The other one (the wider one) even worse, only cut wood and got dull very fast.  You need to buy a set of other accessory almost at the same time when you buy the tool.

The headphone opening is big enough in 60% of the cases but I have a bunch of speakers with aux cords and some are a little bit. But still manages to fit ok! Just squishes the case2. More seriously, the charging port could be a little more spacey. It's better than another case I had but it could just be a little bit bigger! It's a problem on occasionOverall, everythings good. The button access on the sides is perfect and this case has a very nice and slim fit with a perfect amount of tack for grip on most surfaces but not too much to pull your pockets inside out when getting your phone.Seems like a pretty solid case! It'll def save your phone but if you expect often and hard falls, maybe get a bulkier and sturdier case. I take really good care of my phone so this is just to rescue from a few drops and nothing crazy. Just waist level drops to the floor."],[3.0,"As far as quality, this is what I expected from a store-bought costume. The issue with this item is the size. My daughter is 19 months old and very small for her age and this costume was just the right size for her, despite being a Toddler 2-4 size. Perhaps the item I received was missized; however, even for a 1-2 size it was smaller than I hoped. The hat was WAY too small, so I had to make adjustments by cutting it so that it would fit on her head.

When I first saw the LUXA2 brand I was hesitated a little bit because it is not a really well known brand, however, after I received the product, the quality, functionality and style totally surpassed my expectation !!First of all .. IT LOOKS GOOD ON YOU !! you will not look bad when you pull this out in the public ..Secondly, it charges FAST !! sometimes it even feels like faster than wall charger ! ( exaggerated a little bit there but you know what I mean when you are on the road ) ..Third .. some people might see it as a negative star but I actually like the weight of it because I can feel the quality built of the overall product !!Even though there are so many others out there but I think LUXA2 is definitely on to something in this competitive market !!

Added to the mix are globs of pine sap, which are blackish and sticky.  I managed to remove most of these marks with scrubbing, but there were a few stubborn marks that just would not come off the floor.

At the gym, walking, etc. Also: Unlike Sony (and other) in-ear buds, the cord lengths for both sides were equal. (Sony's had a short one side so that you can supposedly put the cord behind your head, which is incredibly awkward & does NOT work for everyone).CON: Although the bass was more consistent with the Griffin earbuds (because they were actually staying in my ears), the painful high frequencies (treble) were nearly unbearable. The only way to tame these was to change EQ on the ipod for \"small speakers\" which sort of flattens the sound out and reduces the treble as much as possible. Still so much treble that I need to turn the volume low to not feel the pain. Sometimes I like my music LOUD. The extra treble just *feels* like ear damage.But here's the worst CON -- When one little grey ear cap fell off my headphone inexplicably somewhere between the gym and home, I realized I now have to throw away a perfectly functioning pair of headphones. I was super-careful to make sure that this detachable part was always there, and keep the earbuds in a case when not in use, so I have NO idea how this happened.In short, a decent price for earbuds that won't last you that long unless you never leave the house with them, but then what's the point of the in-ear feature?"],[4.0,"Good pots for keeping various plants in although they're aren't meant to be decorative.

This is all to a point of course and assuming that you can maintain an even FINAL bevel,(the cutting edge).  Not great for taking off a lot of steel on the harder steels.  I found it difficult to reset the secondary bevel on a CPM-M4 Benchmade, but this is tough stuff. For the final bevel on that same knife though this will put a nasty sharp edge on the finished edge.  Of course this not the final step with this system, and will not get the ultimate result, but as with everything that Syderco makes, it is a wonderful product."],[5.0,"I bought it for the wardrobe.

I used the red one twice and the pegs were fine, no complaints. Then I use the green loom, and all the pegs started coming off when I would hook them over. Very annoying. The pegs will still go back in as I'm knitting, so it didn't ruin my hat but its very annoying to have to keep sticking the pegs back in every two or three rounds.

I have numerous only IDE drives and need to be able to get to old backup files. The Seagate drives I have worked perfectly, while the one Maxtor drive didn't work at all. The Maxtor drive has a wider jumper pin bay between the power plug and the data cable. So it would not insert into the device.  Fortunately I mainly have Seagate drives so that is not a big issue.  I don't have any SATA drives lying around to try it on so I have no idea how good that is. It is so convenient being able to insert a drive and go, that I have decided to use it to do my system backups to harddrives instead of to tape.  Some reviews say that have had problems getting the system to recognize the drive after inserting.  This has not been a problem for me.  It behaves much the same way as a thumb drive does.  The only difference I have really notices is in the drive letter selection. Unlike a thumb drive the hard drive apparently gets a higher priority in the drive letter selection.  So when it is inserted any thumb drive you have inserted into the same device will get shuffled downward and its letter will be given to the new harddrive.  The Eject option is also not available, like it is for other external media.  But the drive can still be disconnected in the USB taskbar tool just like any other drive, so there is no risk in losing data with incomplete data writes.I recommend this device.

I could hear (click, click) the hard drive head flying all over the disk trying to find data.  I was fortunate to get one last Time Machine backup with the help of placing cold compresses above and below my HD to cool it down (old freeze hard drive recovery trick).  I ordered one day service and got it FedEx on a Saturday! YES! Thanks Amazon!  Received in a padded envelope.  Not a big deal since the SSD is light and more shockproof than regular hard drive.  Additionally, the box allows for reasonable cushion as well.  Good that minimal packaging was used.  I hate when packaging is unnecessarily 10 times bigger than the actual product.  Such waste!  From there it was a reformat and restore from Time Machine.  Everything went well and operated like any other HD.My choice to go to SSD was not very deeply researched.  I knew SSD have been around for a while and I knew of the performance and durability it provides.  I know that the ruggedized laptops at work were running SSD.  If those guys are using them in rough conditions then it should be ok.  Since I believe heat was the reason my original drive went, I decided to just go for SSD because of durability reasons.  I knew it was supposed to be faster but didn't know what to expect.  I wasn't paying attention to load times before so I wasn't very impressed initially.  I then used a friend's laptop with similar specs and saw the difference.  The startup and program load up time are definitely shorter.  It just seems like the programs are on the starting line waiting for your click to sprint to the finish line of loading the program.  I did notice the laptop seems to run cooler.  I do photo editing and I did a test to export a set of pictures.  I didn't measure times but I believe time was cut in half.  So far everything is running well!  Some are worried about degraded performance but I think by that time it would be time to get another SSD anyway.  However, I will be mindful of my SSD usage as I say that... haha!I am glad I spent the extra money to get the SSD."],[4.0,"I have tried several different habanero sauces and this comes close to being the perfect red habanero sauce.

The box states: \"Read & Write 2 Hard Drives simultaneously.\" It also states: \"Rapid Data Access & Exchange w Single eSATA or USB Cable Connection.\" NOWHERE does it even mention that you should check to see if you have port multiplier capability (which is absolutely necessary to run two drives over one eSATA cable).At this point most systems DON'T have port multipliers. I'm using a relatively new Dell Precision M4400 with the PM45 chipset. It does NOT support port-multiplying.The device works fine, and is only a couple bucks more than the single slot version, but be aware that you likely WON'T be using two drives at once with eSata on this device.Also, the hole in the dust flap that is meant to keep a 2.5\" drive in place is rather annoying, as it fails to prevent dust from collecting inside the device."],[5.0,"I bought this cable to use with my old HP 5P printer after my old desktop conked out.

There is one small negative though...I started playing RB again after a 15-year layoff, but liability issues  (and common sense) now require eyewear at every gym. I generally don't like this kind of thing, but I'm willing to to accommodate gym rules in order to play such a crazy great game (should be an olympic sport).My first eyewear was given to me by a friend, and I knew after a five-game series that this would be my first RB purchase (before a better racquet, etc.). The eyewear he gave me fogged and was blurry... I couldn't really even play and wanted to just take the damn things off (but couldn't). It was like playing with blinders.So I read up on RB eyewear and decided on these... it's been nine months of heavy-duty play (we play 90-120 minutes for 5-7 games three times a week... there is no dry material on my body at the end of the matches). These have been awesome... crystal clear focus (I normally wear glasses but not for RB), no fog ever (I sweat heavily), no scratches (I wash them before every series and dry them on whatever I have handy). They have adjustable length earpieces and a hearty closed-cell foam band across the entire length of the frame (keeps sweat from running into your eyes).The only negative is that there are cracks in the lens... several small ones that emanate from the nose piece... but they haven't spread and they don't interfere in play at all... I don't see them (they are under 1/8&#34; in length).Bottom line, if I had to buy another pair I would buy these without question.

Unless you are able to keep this in an upright position during non use, I suggest you look for something different. This has a rubber tip with 3 slits, and drips when it is in any other position other than upright. It does have to be popped out of the holder/tray and placed in the proper end to use, which can be a hassle. I replaced the rubber tip with a regular water bottle cap and just use it as a portable water bowl. That way I can throw it in the car or backpack, or dog pack without the leakage problem. The only thing handi about this is the price,  as a water bottle with a corn on the cob plastic tray rubber banded to it does the same thing.

Otherwise Christmas Day is spent running around trying to figure out crazy toys like this one. I have had a hard time with toys before, but this one definitely ranks near the top.First I put in batteries and turn the switch to on. Nothing happens. I put in newly charged batteries, nothing happens. I put in brand new duracells, nothing happens. This might sounds straightforward, but putting batteries in this thing is nothing of the sort. I wondered why there was two screws on the battery lid instead of the normal one on most toys. Its because the force required to press and keep the lid down is like trying to close a suitcase that has two times too many clothes in it. Absurd!Finally, like some others here, I hooked it up to the computer thinking maybe it needed to 'activate' or some such nonsense. The thing turned right on!!! At least it wasn't broken, I thought. After transferring some mp3s, I read the instruction manual thinking maybe there was a trick.The instruction manual was completely USELESS. It had a small diagram of the unit and told how to plug in the USB cable and that's it.I unplugged from the computer and turned the unit on. Nothing. I thought maybe it takes a while to boot up. So I waited a bit. Nothing. Out of frustration I hit the play button thinking that might be the key, voila!! It turned on!!!That's right, on a toy so simply made you could potentially give it to your 2 year old, they make the prerequisite for playing songs, the holding down of the green button after the switch is turned on. So what looks deceptively like the perfect toddler toy is actually a monster of complexity in disguise with a feature that completely kills the ease of use otherwise. However, even 2 year olds are pretty smart with electronics, I'm sure she'll figure it out.Another tip, but if you press and hold the green button while the unit is on, it will shutdown. That's right, press the Green ON button to shutdown!!!I'm reluctant to give this more than two stars because its extremely unlikely that more than 20% of the people who buy this thing will figure out all of the above. I feel sorry for the folks who think the only way to turn this thing on is to plug it into the computer. However, I'm going to go with three, because once I figured all of this out, I know my 2 year old is going to love it, and it will make my wife happy that she's not putting CDs in her boombox and playing music that way anymore."],[4.0,"Bought this for my fiance who loves old school Twista - really old school Hip Hop in general.

Then I hopped into the shower to wash it out and as I started to scrub CHUNKS started to fall into the tub, my long beautiful hair being swept down the drain!!! I got out and looked at my head and noticed that my hard literally MELTED off where I had applied that stuff (mostly on my part line) and what was left of the hair o n my head that had been sprayed lost ALL off its elasticity (the hair underneath was still healthy FYI)! I screamed or my fiance who, thank god, is so positive and understanding, and we started cutting off the hairs that were crispy and figuring out how to fix this. I still had hair left on my other side so I could pretty much do a comb over to conceal this catastrophe. But TRUST me it has been 6 months, an extremely short bob hair cut and lots of trims and my hair in places still feels crispy!

It is not for the weak-minded or the viewer just out for a fun flick to watch. Entertainment is great, but sometimes it is nice to have a challenge or two such as Signs. This movie questions the existence and relationship with a 'higher power' without being new-agie or overtly religious-specific. Gibson and the rest of the cast did a wonderful job of mystery, fear, faith, humor, and just plain acting. The director should be proud of doing such a good job with his limited film budget, awesome artistic cinematography, and production of Signs."],[4.0,"once again great product..but pricey.

The micro-size USB receiver  is almost flush with my laptop, and does not protrude past the charging cord.  The optical tracking is much better than any other wireless mouse I've had.  There is one problem with the design: if you have a tendency to drop stuff, you end up scurrying to catch the skin and the mouse. Which I  have done. Alot.  My dog loves it when I drop it. He goes chasing it as if it were a real mouse. They could have put a more substantial lip so the cover doesn't come off so easily. My dog wouldn't be too happy, though.

Was very pleased with the results on our large-tiled kitchen floor.  Swept first,  then used the steam mop.  I chose the steamer mop pad, and poured a small amount of the cleaning fluid that came with machine, I filled balance of the solution canister as per instructions (warm -- not hot-- tap water. I did not take notice of the time, but it could not have been more than about 25 minutes to steam/clean our large kitchen/hallway areas.  Solution provided by Hoover smells nice and, along with using the steam, did a great job. I will research where I can purchase the solution for less, or just use something else.  Can also use just vinegar solution (advice given by installer of the stone floor in our kitchen).  With vinegar solution, I would choose to have machine do continuous steam cycle.Where extra steam was needed, I pressed the steam lever (lever was comfortable to use, did not cause pain in my arthritic thumb).I had researched several steam moppers, and had considered the Haan, but I am glad that I saw the Hoover and its reviews.  I am happy with my purchase, and the fact that the pads are priced fairly.It was easy to wash the used pad, and I did it by hand, squeezed well, then line dried in my laundry room.Con:  The 2 canisters were a bit difficult for me to take off the steamer, but I have arthritic hands.  I was able to do it by stepping on mop base, leaning the stick against me, then grasping the canister with both hands.  If you do not issues with your hands, you should not experience difficulty.Overall, I am glad that I made this purchase.  Having owned a Shark which always left my floors not as clean as I wanted, this choice is wins hands-down.  The Shark \"died\" several weeks ago and was put in our town's bulk pick-up.  Our local Home-Depot had a ridiculously low price on this model, and S/H was free, however I chose to have the item shipped to the store where I was able to pick it up.

Worked right out of the box.That's everything you need to know, but the review says it needs more words to be acceptable, so I added this sentence."],[4.0,"This truck is AWESOME, and I very badly want to give it five stars.  Why not? Because this truck has a very vulnerable Achilles Tendon that kills the fun.First, the good:  This truck is a very solid performer, easily able to stand against Traxxas's 4WD Stampede.  This truck is actually more user friendly than the 'pede thanks to it's AVC feature.  Turning this feature up stabilizes the truck, at the cost of slight performance reduction.  To share a personal experience about it, I drive this truck with the AVC turned off for maximum performance.  My sister's boyfriend came and watched me drive it.  He had never driven a hobby grade RC, and was very timid when I handed him the transmitter.  He felt the truck was too much for him, so I turned on the AVC.  With the AVC, he quickly gained confidence and had a blast driving it.Now....that Achilles tendon.......is the four drive shafts from the differentials to the wheels.  Vaterra decided to forego traditional dogbone style shafts, and went with telescoping drive shafts.  Plastic drive shafts.  Brittle plastic drive shafts that break easily, even when puttering around on flat ground.  Horizon Hobby has been wonderful about replacing them for me, but I don't like working on the truck every time or every other time I drive it!  A CVD system for this truck is in the works, and I fervently hope that this rectifies this issue.So..... I will happily recommend this truck IF you don't mind constantly replacing driveshafts while you wait for the CVD replacement system to be released,  as this truck truly is a blast to drive for botn beginners and experienced drivers.  If you don't want to deal with the drive shafts, then I suggest watching and waiting for improvements to be made to the drive train."],[5.0,"My daughter is 5 months and loves her Sophie.

After using the Melitta cone and Clever Coffee Dripper for awhile (which are also great products), I decided to give the Hario cone another try as I wanted to get away from using plastic cones.  The Hario happens to sit perfectly on the small four cup carafe that I use. The advantages of the Hario are the porcelain construction helps to keep the coffee hotter longer, and this cone just brews a superior cup of coffee.  I can make two cups as we do not like real strong coffee (I use one level Hario scoop per 12 oz. of water - which seems to be about half the coffee others recommend); therefore, the Size 02 just holds my two scoops of coffee and after a 30 second blooming period, I stir the grounds then use the slow circular pour method with a glass Pyrex measuring cup being careful not to pour above the top of the grounds (water at 198-200 degrees).  As I have to refill the Pyrex once with a second 12 ozs. of water, it helps to keep everything nice and hot (I also cover the top of the cone and Pyrex with plastic lids to preserve heat); stir once again during the last fill. The result is two perfect mugs of coffee every time.  I haven't timed the process, but I think it takes about 5 to 6 minutes from start to finish.  I highly recommend the Hario if you want a superior cup of coffee!"],[1.0,"This is not the same as Ativa Dandelion tea.

It's not overly loud and has a few really nice features, like stopping the brush head if it gets tangled so it doesn't ruin your rug.  Easy to clean, filters just rinse out when dirty, dirt cup easy to dump.  I'm always surprised at how much dirt is in the cup after vacuuming, when I actually thought something was clean.

One is a tennis player and one is a pretty creepy guy with \"big ideas\" (read: the enemy), they hit it off pretty well, but the second man turns out to get too involved with his ideas and ends up killing the tennis player's wife for him after the tennis player nonchalantly mentions he wouldn't mind having her out of the way.  Now it's a rush to see what the tennis player will do now that he's a suspect and the other man keeps appearing to urge him to kill the stalker's father, via an agreement he didn't make.So it's basically all of Hitchcock's usual fare...  a man on the run, wrongly accused; a man blackmailing him; bumbling cops; a woman who wants to figure it out but doesn't know who to trust initially before fully trusting the protagonist; and old ladies who giggle over discussions of murder.This time I don't buy it, though.  The whole lighter thing comes off as a real gimmick to me (even when the stalker guy drops it in the grate... after the initial suspense, it doesn't matter anyway 'cause he's waiting for dusk.)  I couldn't believe that there isn't some way the protagonist couldn't have gone to the police and proven that he wasn't guilty, if anything because of the two characters they were.  The drunken professor was a useless side-note.  This movie is all of Hitchcock's stuff, but none of his experimentation which is really the stuff I like.In all, this is the most suspensful of his movies, but I can't gather up the energy to care for it.  Once again, I have an issue with the characters.  I'm just so used to Hitchcock telling me the same story over and over again that frankly I'm beginning to feel like he's repeating himself.  The guy had a few recurring themes, sure, but this is starting to fall into merely obsessive pondering of the many different ways to present the same internal fear Hitchcock has of being wrongfully imprisoned.  And with each movie of his I see, instead of said fear making me feel like I'm seeing some auteur at work, I'm beginning to see a guy who needs to relax a little.  I like his much more experimental stuff, where he plays with camera and imagery and narrative and design.  This \"suspense thriller\" stuff with the typical motifs is getting very dull, which is a terrible thing.--PolarisDiB"],[3.0,"I'm a side sleeper so I like my pillows more firm.

I don't use this brush to simply brush my dog, I use it when i give her a bath and my dog LOVES it! The brush really does an excellent job of removing ALL the loose hair, and my dog really loves how it feels as the 'nubs' on the brush massage her skin. I have a great dane mix so it takes a while to bathe her, but she doesn't mind because she loves how good this brush makes her feel. She leans into the brush as i scrub her in circles and back and forth. Last time i washed her she didn't even need brushed after her bath- she had no loose hair left- the Kong ZoomGroom removed it all in the bath! And, it's ergonomically shaped so I'm able to get a great grip on the brush.This is the second ZoomGroom i have purchased, as my ex-husband took the first one when he moved out.

I was so impressed with it that I immediately went out and bought two of them.  I wound up giving the extra one I purchased to a friend who also loves it. Therefore, when this T-fal came up for review, I wanted to see how it compared to my Cuisinart.After using this machine a couple of times, I would have rated this T-fal 3-1/2 to 4 stars had I not already owned the Cuisinart.  However, because I am use to such an exceptional ice cream maker, I find this one just okay, so that is why it gets a plain three star-rating from me.PROS- It makes one quart of good ice cream (my Cuisinart makes two quarts)- I made both the strawberry ice cream and the lemon sorbet. The ice cream was good. The lemon sorbet came out excellent; although I was surprised the recipe did not call for heating the egg white.  (My Cuisinart recipe uses water instead of egg white.)- I consider the currently listed price of $34.99 reasonable and it's less than half the price of the Cuisinart I purchased.- This machine is quieter than my Cuisinart.CONS- The ice cream recipes are not exceptional.  Although my strawberry ice cream came out good, it was not as creamy or sweet as the recipe that came with my Cuisinart and it tasted icy or more like sorbet. The recipes that came with my Cuisinart are outstanding and a bit more flavorful and probably more calories too.  For instance, the T-fal strawberry ice cream recipe calls for strawberries, powdered sugar, lemon, and heavy cream.  My Cuisinart recipe also includes adding whole milk and vanilla extract and it uses regular sugar instead of powdered and calls for about  more sugar than the T-fal recipe. I did not mark it down for this because this has nothing to do with the ice cream maker itself and recipe books can always be purchased.- The chute on the cover is a little too small so it is not as easy to pour in the ingredients without messing up the top.- Assembling and disassembling the unit is \"sticky\" and tricky.  I had trouble removing the freezer bowl from the base because there is no grip when pulling straight up.  Even lining up the top and locking that in place was cumbersome; although after several tries I have that down well.  The paddle also requires a good push to get it into the motor but now seats easily.- The instructions for cleaning are not adequate.  There are actually 6 parts to this ice cream maker (as opposed to the 5 parts shown in the instructions).  My Cuisinart only has 4 parts.  In order to clean everything but the motor, I had to dissemble all parts. Getting the bowl out of the base is the most difficult.  However, I had to dissemble the lid after making ice cream because the ice cream got stuck in the crevices of the top.  I did not have to do this after the sorbet.  The lid coms apart easily as long as I flexed it when I pulled it away from the nubs holding it in place.- In my opinion, the bowl takes up an odd amount of space in my freezer compared to my Cuisinart. My Cuisinart 2-QT bowl is totally cylindrical and measures 7-3/4 inches wide by 6-3/4 inches tall.  This T-fal 1-QT bowl is flared at the top and measures 5-1/2 inches wide at the very bottom to about 9-1/2 wide at the top due to the handles.  It also measures 6-1/2 inches tall.No matter what machine one chooses, making ice cream is messy and requires prior preparation because of the cooking instructions and the fact that time is needed in the freezer for the ice cream to harden. Also making ice cream usually costs more than buying the pre-made product. The joy I get from making my own home-made product, however, far outweighs these caveats.In summary, although I cannot attest to the longevity of this machine, I think this is a decent ice cream maker for making small quantities of ice cream.  Had I not owned a Cuisinart, I would have been more pleased with this machine.  However, the cumbersome assembly and disassembly is the main reason it is a three star machine to me.PS For those who are interested, I pasted a link to my Cuisinart review in the comments section of this evaluation."],[5.0,"This is a darling salt and pepper shaker set that we bought to go with our Halloween tablecloth.

This one definitely attracts ants as opposed to other brands that just don't have any effect on them. It helped me figure out where is the colony because of ant trail. Before putting it out I had no idea what is the source. Luckily ants were coming from under the baseboard in bathroom behind toilet bowl. I put these just in front of the ant hole. Ant stormed on them and didn't bother coming any further so no ant was seen in rest of the house as long as we have the baits in front of the colony. It seems to work because ants went crazy on it for 2 days and then disappeared, after 2 days new batch of ants went crazy on them. I kept replacing with new bait stations. It has been going on for 3 weeks and 5/6 generations of ants have been fed on my expense. I am not sure if this killing them or I am having ant farm. I have read mostly positive reviews of this product and am so disappointed that it is not working for us. Ants for sure disappears for 2 days before new one comes. Also, they move very slowly just before disappearing implying they had been effected by poison. So this product is worth trying.Finally, when last batch was wreaking havoc on the bait I generously sprayed windex (glass cleaner) on them and on the nest. It killed them on contact and I made sure that a lot of windex gets seeped into the nest. It has been 4 days since, no more ants so far. I think I will stick with windex until I get another solution. Any advice?Am I attracting ants from different colonies? But source of trail is always the same place, the hole behind bowl. Can there be multiple colonies in the walls or ground but ants are showing up from same hole because I put bait in front of it? To counter that problem I am going to put cinnamon sticks in front of that hole as it has worked for another hole in the house. No ants are seen coming out of bedroom hole that is stucked with cinnamon sticks for 2 months now. On unrelated note, I have killed 5 ants that looked like queens a couple of weeks ago. I was so happy to catch them believing that killing queen is the end of colony but no success on that one."],[5.0,"We purchased the Razor MX500 for our 4 year old son.

We have 2 dogs, one who sheds like a monster, and the amount of hair this cleaner picked up directly after using our old vacuum was insane.  Not to mention we filled a whole canister just from cleaning the couch with the detachable tool.  When I saw the amount of dust leaving most vacuums in the infomercial, I knew that was were our dust problem was coming from.  Now we only dust once a week and the house even smells better.

On the way out of town, however, two street teens let themselves into her car, hold her at gunpoint, and demand that she drives them to wherever she's going. Thus begins a \"vacation\" that will change everything, forever.With an underlying message of \"there are two kinds of people in the world, those who need to be rescued, and those who want to rescue,\" the plot takes many turns that are intelligently connected and have surprising secrets (who knew it would turn into a lesbian story?) that make all three characters both heroes and victims.Show Me is a story about a seemingly happy and perfect yuppy colliding paths with two distraught teenagers left on their own and yearning to get out.

My mom ordered it for me as an early Xmas present.  After one use, it looks like it's the first time my floor has been vacuumed since I moved into my apt.

The plastic is so cheaply molded and poorly finished that a large scab of excess material prevented it from even being opened.  I had to disassemble the whole thing (tough to do without cracking the plastic), take a Dremel tool to it and grind down about an eighth of an inch of material from the back of the lid to make it where the lid could even open.  The lock mechanism is a little tricky at first, and not well-explained or obvious in operation... you have to pull the knob out toward you before turning, and then it locks in the open position.  To close again you have to shut the lid firmly and give it a slight twist in the \"open\" direction before it will unhitch and lock.Overall though, once I made those modifications and got used to the lock operation, I have to say it serves the purpose... it stores the blades and disks safely and securely.  I would have expected better craftsmanship of a Cuisinart product, though... this was definitely not a polished product.Update:  My mother got a similar Cuisinart food processor and wanted this blade and disc holder, so I got it for her last Christmas, figuring that I could do the same tweaking to it so that it would work fine for her out of the box.  When I got it and checked it out, either they've improved their manufacturing process and quality control, or I just had a really bad one for myself, since the one I got for mom worked fine."],[5.0,"Fits his camelBak bottle perfectly, I am so glad I could just replace the parts instead of having to buy a entire new bottle."],[4.0,"Nothing much to it.

After a couple weeks of trying crackers, cheese, peanut butter, etc., with few results, I put out five of these traps last night with Wildlife Mix in them, and this morning I had four mice.

The teacher really appreciated it (and I appreciated that it was a lot less expensive than buying smaller packs of pencils)."],[5.0,"I scanned over 2400 Ektochrome slides, over 3000 photos and over 1000 35mm film strips using this scanner and was pleased with the results. Being able to scan 12 35mm slides and four to six photos at a time is a tremendous time saver.If you expect to load the film in the scanner and push one button and have the scanner/software do the rest, you will be disappointed. If you are willing to do a minimal amount of work you can get excellent results in a reasonable amount of time.As of February 2012 all the delivered software will install on Windows 7. I installed all the software on a Windows 7 64 Bit Professional system and had no problems. I also has no problems with crashes or other software malfunctions while using the software.As mentioned in other reviews the provided documentation is extremely minimal and using the scanner/software requires extension experimentation and trial and order. Two sites providing detailed technical reviews of the scanner and software which I found useful are:[...]I used the Epson software for all my scanning. I tried the provided Silverfast SW and a trial version of VueScan but found that the Epson software best took advantage of the features of the V700 scanner. With the other software I could never scan 12 slides of multiple photos in one scan. The Silverfast web site indicates that they will provide a free upgrade to their latest version, but they haven't updated that version for the V700 so I did not bother with it.I scanned my slides and 35 mm film strips at 4800 DPI to JPEG files with the Epson software using the HOME mode with color restoration enabled. As far as I can determine the Home Mode is the only mode that allows you to scan 12 slides or multiple film strips at one time. The Professional mode seems to only allow you to scan one slide at a time. It took 10 to 15 minutes to scan 12 slides at 4800 DPI. The automatic marqueeing or outlining seemed to work pretty well in this mode. I used the Prescan option to check the images before final scanning.The slide numbering scheme in the slide holder is9  5  1  White dots10  6  211  7  312  8  4For scanning slides, negatives or film strips the document mat should be removed.I scanned my photographs with the Epson software using the Professional mode. I scanned the photos at 1200 DPI to JPEG files with color restoration enabled. The Professional Mode allows you to scan multiple photos in one scan. I was able to scan four to six photos in one scan using this mode depending on the size of the photos. After the photos are Pre-Scanned it is necessary to marquee or outline them manually before final scanning. However, the Epson software remembers the marquees or outlines from  scan to scan so if you place the photos in the same position from scan to scan you can minimize the manual marqueeing usually having to adjust only one of them. It takes about three to four minutes to scan six photos at 1200 DPI.The Home mode allows you to scan multiple photos without manual outlining or marqueeing but does not allow photoshop like correction to be made during the scan.The photo numbering scheme for six photos is;TOP2  14  36  5For scanning photographs or documents the document mat should be installed.I did a Web search to determine what DPI to use for scanning. This search seemed to indicate that for archiving slides or negatives 4000 DPI was sufficient and for photos 600 DPI was sufficient. The V700 seems to only scan at discrete DPI's so using anything other than what the Epson software provides(Silverfast or VueScan) results in software interpolation being done.If you want to verify what DPI your scanned picture are you can use Adobe Photoshop to do this:Open the digital image in PhotoshopSelect Image->Image SizeResolution will be shown in pixels per inch.Problems I had using the scanner and software:1. As another reviewer mentioned the software sometime has problems with imageswith dark borders. I had this problem with 4 or 5 slides and it requiredplaying around with different modes and options to get around the problem2. The colors in several of my photos/slides of red/orange sunsets did notscan properly. They came out too blue. I could never get Epson orSilverfast to scan them properly. I had to use Photoshop to adjust thecolor and even then it did not correctly match the original.Summary:All in all the V700 scanner and software worked very well and I would recommend it.I did not find the Epson software to be terrible as some reviewers have indicated.I experienced no crashes or serious bugs when using the software. The Abort processing even worked correctly even though that is a feature that often doesn't work properly."],[3.0,"I chose this item after reading other reviews.  However, I returned it - it is extremely loud, the steam vents out the top, under wood cupboards and I had a very difficult time pouring water in the skinny opening without getting everything wet.

Just about the time I finished making a bracket and went to install it - the image started cutting in and out.  Wiggling the wires seems there might be a loose wire in the harness somewhere.  Funny - I did not notice this when I was first playing with it.  Eventually - even if I moved the wire to the point that it would work - the image on the screen was full of diagonal lines and not visible.  It's dead now.  It had a lifespan of about 30 minutes.

Im sure that there's a few that are actually deficient, but what I mean is there are always people who want it really cold. I suggest that if you have doubts about its cooling abilities, don't just look at the temperature, look at the humidity too, that's a big part.I looked through the reviews hoping to find something about this, but it seems like i'm the only one, so it could be from something else.

The stats are these:6V supply (4*1.5V cells)2.2 Ohm resistorLED voltage drop 3.3V-> 2.7v voltage drop on resistor-> 1.2A current!= 3.2 Watts dissipated (wasted) through resistorThis really is no good at all so I changed the internals ever-so-slightly...Where the power connects the the LED PCB, remove the cross-links (actually the legs of one of the LEDs) so the boards are not connected to each other at that point.At the opposite end connect the bottom left track to the top right and remove the other cross-link.And that's it. I've up loaded an image of this for you to refer to.The stats are now these:6V supplyLED voltage drop = 2*2.9V (now 2 sets of 12 LEDs in series)-> 0.2V drop across resistor-> 0.06A current= 0.012 Watts dissipated through resistor.Now the light will be quite a bit dimmer, but now the run-time can be measured in days rather than hours and there'll be absolutely no over heating of the resistor."],[4.0,"I purchased this toy for my son and he loves it.

I own every film available on DVD, I own the video games, I own quite a few of the soundtracks on CD and I will be the first in line when \"vs. Biollante\", \"vs. Megalon\" and \"1985\" hit DVD and pay whatever is asked just so I can complete my collection. Yes, I can even sit through the Matthew Broderick travesty that bears the name \"Godzilla\".That being said....I'm not sure how anyone, fan or non-fan, can enjoy \"King Kong vs. Godzilla\"???? This film is so astonishingly awful, it veers way off of the \"So Bad It's Good\" track onto the simply horrible realm at about 20 minutes in. I love bad b-movies, I'll sit back and watch \"Mesa of Lost Women\" or \"Eegah\" all day long, but \"Kong vs Godzilla\" is mind numblingly awful. Where to begin....1. King Kong does not look like \"King Kong\". This ratty ape suit looks like it's barely holding together, and the nightmarishly barely animated hand-puppet face used for close ups of the giant ape is grade school level F/X at best.2. While having a strong plot isn't exactly key to a successful Godzilla film, Kong's storyline is so minimal as to not exist. Basically a company has found out these island berries can get you intoxicated, so they want to steal them. Unfortunately they happen to be King Kong's drink of choice as well. So basically the events of the film occur because some Japanese folks and King Kong both want to get high! Godzilla only gets involved because the worlds worst submarine captain doesn't understand that iceburgs don't simply float on top of the water, and that most of the ice is actually below the water's surface, thus ramming his nuclear sub into Godzilla's ice prison.3. The UN / American footage. I don't know if watching the original Japanese version of this film would help much, but the American version with the narrator/UN report guy is amazingly dull. For some reason there is a space station shown, and some maps, a Japanese correspondant who doesn't know how to wear headphones....and everybody is watching the events unfold on a 10\" color TV screen? The American scientist is awful as well, you have to love when he holds up a small gumball and states that it is the size of Godzilla's brain??? What???4. The fight scenes are dull. If nothing else you can usually rely on Toho films to provide some decent monster fights in their films...not so much here. Sure Godzilla and Kong meet for a final showdown about 10 minutes before the film ends...but it's just bad...and worse there really isn't a conclusion.Luckily, Godzilla would go on to much better things after this third entry in the series. I guess as a Godzilla fan I'm happy to have this disk in my collection, I can't imagine I'll pull it out very often (maybe in another 10 years or so?), but as a completist I had to own it."],[3.0,"Put aside for a minute the fact that Ocean's Twelve was undoubtedly made with the primary purpose of giving its A-list cast an excuse to lounge around in southern Italy for a few months. Put aside also the fact that this is a sequel to the decent (though unspectacular) Ocean's Eleven of a few years ago, which was itself a remake of an earlier (again unmemorable) star vehicle for Frank Sinatra and the Rat Pack. The bloodlines of this franchise have been diluted more than European royalty.Take Ocean's Twelve for what it is: an entertaining heist movie with a fairly porous plot that nevertheless yields some good moments. High art it is not, but I found myself enjoying the ride while it lasted.There are a million reasons why this film shouldn't work, but the cast and crew do manage to pull a competent flick together in between the off-screen debauchery and carousing.

Lacking that one's wealth of enthralling songs, it nevertheless impresses with its own gems like Still Learning How To Crawl, Sleeping In The Devil's Bed and The Unbreakable Chain. The folky song with snatches of French here is The Collection of Marie Claire while Unbreakable Chain, the moving story of a mother and son's reunion, has that same French feel. Another touching song is Lotta Love with its chiming guitars, a tale of addiction and redemption. Indian has Native American drumming and reminds me slightly of Joni Mitchell's Lakota on Chalk Mark In A Rainstorm. The production is magical, as to be expected from Lanois: atmospheric instrumentation - including evocative synths - backing his soulful voice. This is a very good album offering much in the way of stirring, memorable music and Lanois remains true to his vision."],[5.0,"This works great and comes with a warranty.

The effect isn't long lasting, and is certainly more effective on fine lines -- I know because I also tried it on those deeper furrows between my brows -- and I guess that's why it's marketed for those fine lines around the eyes. Although there is a subtle improvement of those fine lines, the difference just isn't enough to be worth the price, in my opinion.

NOT a garbage COMMA truck transformer. A waste management garbage truck transformer. I know, just take a minute to let the awesome sink in. Transformer Animate Wreck-gar is a great toy. His color palette of oranges, tomato reds, grays and ochres are a homage to his original G1 character. The truck is nice example of the translation from Animated's visual stylizing to physical toy. I especially the lifting arms gimmick on the front. I only wish the truck windows had been rendered in clear plastic, which shouldn't have been hard to do since it's a solid non transforming facade. (also the headlights and tail lights are transparent plastic with paint apps over them?!)The transformation is easy, but my Wreck-gar is pretty solid when pegged together and stiff in some joints so he might be more difficult for younger hands. Again your Wreck-gar may vary. He basically transforms out of his truck back which becomes a backpack in robot mode. Since it actually *was* a backpack in the show, this is one of the few cases of a backpack-former where it makes sense. I wish the door on the back of his truck mode opened so he could actually use the 'backpack' in robot mode like on the show. But, the storage of his weapons in a hidden pocket kinda make up for the backpack issues Robot mode is sweet. Captures the characterization perfectly down to the little details, crooked smirk, robo-facial hair and antenna on his TV head. Fairly poseable with articulated hands, and the light piping in the eyes works amazingly better than I expected. Oddly he only displays an Autobot symbol in vehicle mode.All in all, Animated Wreck-gar is a good solidly build and cleverly designed figure. I'd recommend for kids, collectors, fans of the show, fans of Weird Al, garbage truck enthusiasts... He originally retailed for about 20 bucks and sometimes goes for around 40 MISB on some sites, but if you can find him for around 20-25 or so he's great quirky bot. \"Dare to be Stupid,\" Indeed!And remember parents: If you don't like challenging your children, BUY AGE APPROPRIATE."],[5.0,"I use it primarily in my laser printer.

As for longevity, it's too soon to tell"],[5.0,"IMO, there are two pocketable megazoom cameras on the market with the highest image quality.  They are the Canon SX260 and this Panasonic ZS15.  In addition to high image quality (the most important feature IMO), both cameras are about the same size (large end of pocketable) and both have about the same optical zoom.  However, there are still reasons to choose the Panasonic ZS15.  The main reason for me (and the one most reviewers never mention) is the extra optical zoom up to 25x if you limit the image size to 5 MPix which is large enough for a quality 8x10 inch print.  Then there is an extra 2x zoom for a total of 50x which is apparently an interpolated digital zoom involving a little image quality degradation.  (The camera has a digital zoom in addition to the 50x which I never use.  I can use digital zoom on a computer after the fact.)  So, with 25x true optical zoom and the ability to get a shot at 50x if necessary, this is an amazing camera.  It has aperture and shutter priority settings as well as manual. These features are also important although the intelligent automatic mode (iA) does well in many conditions.  There is also an intelligent resolution feature which adds beautiful sharpness to many photos.  That feature is always present in iA and may be included in the other settings as well.There are three other features that made me choose the Panasonic ZS15.  1. It does not have a GPS which is a power draining option that I never use in a camera.  (I tend to know where my photos were taken - close enough.)  2. It does not shoot RAW which I never do.  3. By omitting features 1 & 2, the price of the Panasonic is significantly below the Canon (typically $70 although prices change frequently.)"],[2.0,"No screws!

Unfortunately, they took a different direction after Welcome (October 2002) with Blue Sky Research (August 2005).2002's Welcome separated Taproot from the generic Nu Metal infestation of this decade with off-time beats most clearly heard in songs like Everything, Fault and Sumtimes. Poem was Welcome's claim to radio play and it was a great, foot stompin' rocker. There were different styles and sounds to the tunes on Welcome, and the songs didn't have the Nu Metal Nickelback epidemic of not being able to tell when the track has changed.Sure, Taproot clearly was influenced by Alice in Chains. In fact, Toby Wright, Welcome's producer, even co-produced some AiC disks. And singer Stephen Richards has an unmistakably clear singing voice that is a bit similar to the late, great Layne Staley.But Taproot were definitely their own band on Welcome and put out one of the most unique sounding hard rock disks of 2002.Unfortunately, Taproot lost some of their unique sound with Blue Sky Research, and went to the Nickelback monochromatic formula for some odd reason. My guess it was pressure from their label (Atlantic) to take the fun and creativity out of the music and make more radio friendly music (indeed they hired Billy Corgan [Smashing Pumpkins] to help with some of the Blue Sky tracks).This past summer drummer Jarrod Montague revealed on Taproot's MySpace blog that the band had parted ways with Atlantic Records. So hopefully Taproot's 4th release will get back to the music that made them unique and hard.Hard rockers looking for something mostly unique with a bit of an Alice in Chians Dirt influence should absolutely pick up Welcome."],[3.0,"When we realized that we couldn't use it to make frozen tortoise bites, we just kind of tossed it somewhere.

I also own the sheepskin lined leather tool belt, and this is the perfect addition.  My toolbelt was not designed to go with these suspenders so they did require some minor modification in order to use them.  My pouches do not have a continous belt so the loops that the suspenders come with do not just slide on.  I had to drill out the rivits on the loops and drill some holes in my pouches and rivit the metal part of the loop to my pouches.  I placed the rivits slightly out of center as to favor my left-side pouches.  I use that side more so it is very convienient. All the other guys on the site are extremely jealous.  These pouches (combined with my tool belt) scream &#34;Professional&#34;.  They are a little stiff in the beginning but feel incredibly durable.  I had already started to experience some severe lower back pain at times and these suspenders really take the pressure off of the lower back. My lower back dosen't feel as fatigued at the end of the day and it actually seems to make my upper back and shoulders stronger. They feel worked-out, but in a good way.One piece of advice is to follow the instructions.  They come with a pair of screw rivits to affix the leather straps to the canvas material near the middle back area.  This is so that black part of the harness does not slide back or forth on the leather straps.  WEAR THEM FOR ABOUT TWO WEEKS, before securing the straps with the screw rivits.

I have eczema on my upper arms and within two days this product took care of it, as in they are soft and smooth. I also use this on my face a lot. I tend have some mild rosacea on my cheeks and acne-prone skin. I use my facial anti-aging serium and then put a layer of this over my whole face and neck for moisture. After a few minutes, I then put an extra amount on my cheeks where I have the rosacea and it smooths it out and calms it down. This product has AHAs in it, so I'm surprised it didn't cause me to flare up.  As I said, I also use this on my neck, where I have always had rough, bumpy skin, and it smooths it into buttery softness. It does leave a bit of a 'tacky' feeling for a few hours, but I only use it at night. I REALLY wish Eucerin would make this exact product (NO SPFs as they irritate my skin beyond belief!) into a face lotion that absorbs well into facial skin (it's non-comodonogenc so it does not exactly absorb into the skin, but sits on top more). I've tried some of their face lotions and was not that impressed. I think Eucerin needs to approach their face lotions from their current line of body moisturizers and tweak them slightly. I want my facial moisturizer to be super moisturizing, have urea in it, have anti-aging benefits, and feel like I have nothing on it at all. Not asking much, I know!!  But, I know it's possible and I know Eucerin can do it because they have made a magical product in this moisturizer. For the record, I hate their original body lotion!

Even if I wake up after 6 hours (my baby sleeps now that long at night), the pads are really full but no leaking!  And what's best is while I know they are full of milk, I don't feel wet.  I still use the cotton pads while at home during the day, but use these at night and when going out.  Very happy!"],[5.0,"I was like so many other people who were led to believe that the Excalibur dehydrator was the best one. Maybe it's really great, but this dehydrator, which costs approximately half of the Excalibur price after figuring in all the add-ons necessary to get it working, actually has the same features, and dare I say: even more.This model has ten trays. The Excalibur has nine. This model comes with two nonstick liners and a device to close off four trays' width for times when you want to take them out to place rising dough or culturing yogurt in it instead. You need to buy those things at extra cost for the Excalibur model.  Neither model has a timer. Both models have adjustable temperature.The STX does not heat up my kitchen. That's really nice since I prefer to dehydrate rather than cook during the 105+ degree summer weather. It takes up a large part of my biggest counter. I planned on that, so for me it's not a hardship. I just made extra space on my other counters.I have had this machine running continuously for five days now, since a couple of days after I got it. When I first turned it on it exuded a burning sort of smell, which concerned me. In the manual it says to run it for 45 minutes at 95 degrees. So I did that, and after approximately 5 minutes the smell went away. It hasn't come back since. It is also very quiet. I believe the people who say this machine is noisy have never owned a dehydrator before. I owned a Nesco model from the late 1990's. Now that thing was noisy! This one sounds like running a small fan, which is mostly what it is. No, it's not pretty. It looks very utilitarian, and it is.I would advise anyone who is looking at the Excalibur and shaking their head at the expense to try this dehydrator. It really works nicely."],[5.0,"Maybe a little sweeter than I prefer, but the crowd at work loved them.

Probably isn't going to give quite the image quality that this lens will, but it's very impressive.  I think if you're considering buying this lens and you're not a pro and don't like lugging around a your big DSLR all the time you will love the S95.

Easier to just go to home depot and find one to match it.  But the construction of the chin up bar is solid and I'm excited to get it up and use it.

Here are some Pros that I found:1) The bottle is affordable.2) The bottle is durable. It is made out of plastic, but it is hard plastic that returns to its original shape when you squeeze it.3) It looks great. The bottle itself looks very sleek and shiny, making it nice to take anywhere from your house, to work, gym, when you are running, and everything in between. I personally use it when going to gym and when I am in my college dorm.4) The water tastes great. I hate the water in my college dorm. It tastes horrible. With this, I can't taste that awful chlorine or as I call it \"pipe\" taste.5) The tether that you can use to carry your bottle with one finger is attached to the cup. When you unscrew the cap, you can either push the cap down where it is attached to the bottle, making it easier to drink your water, or you can pull it all the way up and hold it with your hand while drinking.6) The little filter indicator under the filter lets you set a month when you bought your filter so you will know when to change it again (every 3 months or so, depending on your usage).7) A gentle squeeze gets a lot of water going through the filter, and the filter allows air to go in after you let go of the bottle. This is pretty quiet.I am very happy with this bottle. I think it makes the water taste great and I've noticed I drink a lot more water now, which is always a plus."],[2.0,"For the money, not the best quality - I would think again about purchasing this product.

Received this tool box as a gift."],[5.0,"I hesitated at first to buy this after reading some of the negative reviews from others but saw there was room for misunderstanding by people who tried to use this for grinding large nuts and non-oily grains which it was never designed to process. Pumpkin seed kernels are marginally too large. It is made to grind poppy seeds and works equally well for similar seeds like sesame, flax, chia... and you can mix-in fractional amounts of dry spices like black pepper, nigella, sichuan pepper, annato, lemon peel, garlic granules, etc. If you mistakenly try to grind almonds the first large nut into the grinder mechanism will push the screw feeder to one side where it could jam and will cause excessive wear. The small seeds by contrast distribute themselves in the grinder and create a lubricating layer between the inner and outer surfaces. This mill can be a tool to change your diet to include many tasty, healthy spices and seeds."],[5.0,"Bought this for my 2013 Ford F150 with 6.5 foot bed.

As I ran through the house grabbing my coffee and looking for my keys, I hastily placed an order for more deodorant (with next day shipping). When it arrived, I realized that I had ordered Degree Clinical Protection instead of Secret Clinical Strength. Oops.I assumed that they are both made by people in white lab coats and work basically the same for people who need a little extra help in the scent control department. But, I found that the Degree deodorant lasted much longer than the Secret I had been using. Not only did I still feel fresh at the end of the day (after spending two hours commuting in August), I felt reasonably dry and smell free after walking several miles at the gym that evening.The scent is very clean but not overpowering. It simply smells fresh. Also, I was able to wear it with a black shirt and not find any stains or smudges (this has to be attributed to the product and not user skill).The only thing that I noticed is that the product that I received is slightly different than the one pictured.

You waste your money buying it."],[5.0,"This is the western for which Clint Eastwood ought to have won his Oscars. Included on almost every important \"Best of\" list for 1976, Eastwood's amazing cinematic masterpiece was all but snubbed by the Academy. That he was finally recognized for the much-inferior \"Unforgiven\" is a shameful irony. The western genre was in decline by the 1970s and had largely devolved into cliche or cartoonish parody. The genius of Eastwood's vision was to take traditional western stereotypes and turn them on their heads, demythologize the rigidly black/white good-vs-evil Saturday matinee morality, and show us characters with real depth, real motivations and real inner conflicts; not always \"good\" or always \"bad\" but sometimes walking a fine line, driven to one side or the other by circumstances beyond one man's control. The look of the film is gorgeous, showing us a smokey, autumnal by-gone world, sometimes crude, often gritty. It's not clear we'd want to live in such a time or place, but we are drawn in nonetheless. Wonderful acting, and a whole passel of great character actors, including the inimitable Chief Dan George, bring the story to vibrant life. There's plenty of action to keep the adrenaline flowing, and the story draws to a logical, satisfying, if artfully understated, conclusion. The score is also worthy of note; spare and expansive all at once, it ranks as one of the best to come out of the 1970s. This is absolutely-must-see."],[3.0,"when i ordered these i was looking for a 4mm crystal bead and these are not true to size as all of the other 4 mm beads i use. they are slightly larger then the other beads. while they still work fine for what i am making i just would have liked to have known before i purchased and i would have bought a different one."],[4.0,"This charger is great.

I got a bluetooth speaker I've been using in the shower for months and had it running off my phone which sits at my computer desk, and for $9 I figured I'd be able to drop the hassle of switching between my computer and phone for music when I took a shower and have a more seamless audio experience (when I disconnect the bathroom speaker and get out, the computer speakers would pick back up).  Unfortunately, the dongle seems to be good for about 10 feet of range and starts stuttering at 15.  At 20 feet in the bathroom with the door wide open, it's simply unusable, akin to streaming music over a dialup connection.  When it connects.So if you need a bluebooth connection for devices that will sit a foot or two away, or even 10, I'm sure the product works fine, but falls well below the standard of 30 feet.

Putting it blatantly.Jumping right in, let's look at the beaters. Easy to click in, hard to get off. Also, they seem to be on the shorter side.It doesn't offer much power. Simple cookie doughs I've found defeat this mixer. Not just defeat, mind you, but beats it to the point that it smells as if the motor is about to catch fire. Oh, and lets not forget the smoke while all that's going down.The speed settings are nice but when you really get down to it, 6 speeds is a bit much. A simpler 3 speed with more power would have been more desired. The differences from 2 to 3, or 4 to 5 aren't that significant.Finally, the cord is a little short. You gotta be close to an outlet or else you won't be using this bad boy without an extension cord, which seems a bit ridiculous.All in all, yes, this does come with a nice bowl and lid that makes for easy and neat storage but it just comes up too short in the power department to warrant a purchase from someone actually looking to do any amount of real cooking with it.

Shirley plays a talented orphan, Rebecca Winstead, who wins a radio contest, and despite some twists and turns in the plot, eventually finds stardom in New York.  The film closes with Shirley and Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson in a great tap routine to Raymond Scott's hit, \"The Toy Trumpet.\"  William Demarest, Gloria Stuart, Jack Haley, and Randolph Scott are among the featured character actors in the film.This film - in both B&W; and colorized versions - is a must-have for Temple fans of all ages.  It features English fake stereo and mono soundtracks, a Spanish soundtrack, and subtitles in both languages.

I had trouble choosing which fisheye lens (Opteka, Bower, Rokinon), mostly because I thought that ten more dollars more for the Opteka lens would get me a better lens. However, I found out that the fisheye lenses are actually made from the same company, but have other names on them (Opteka, Bower, Rokinon). This was the wisest decision I made (the extra ten dollars got me one day shipping).The lens itself is quite heavy, heavier than my nikkor 18-55 and 55-200. I didn't let that bother me. I don't want to get into technical specs, so the only thing I have to say is this fisheye lens does not have vignetting. Some people like that, some people don't.  The distortion isn't that of a \"true\" fisheye.  Without the vignetting and the distortion of a \"true\" fisheye, this lens is a wide angle lens and a fisheye lens.

The basic game is similar to the old parlor game, where each player has to repeat what all the players have said up to him/her, then add a new word beginning with the next letter in the alphabet. This game is a lot more fun, though, because there are cards that tell each player what to do or say. Some are to act like a certain animal (silently or with sound effects), others are to say a phrase, others to act out a certain motion. I lost last time, because although I remembered to say, \"Seriously,\" then scratch my head, then imitate the sound and motion of a snake, then pretend to swim, then say, \"Gotcha!\" then take my own pulse, and then howl at the moon like a wolf, alas I forgot that the next item in the list was to pretend to juggle. My two 10-year olds beat me 10 to 9 to zero. At first, I thought the game was so simple that for adults it might best be considered a drinking game, but after that (and other) humiliation(s) I think I'll rest up and stay cold sober in the future.There is a board and a little piece for each player that moves around, depending on how well the player does, and there is nominally a \"winner,\" but really nobody cares much about that aspect, at least they shouldn't. The real value of the game is in the cards that give such a large variety of words and actions to remember. It's a good thing there are several hundred cards!It's probably worth noting that the game is geared completely towards having fun, and the directions, while complete, are quite casual (nobody \"loses\" or \"fails,\" they just \"mess up.\"). However, the game is quite educational too, as it helps concentration and (alert: non-scientific opinion coming) maybe makes people use different parts of their brains as they remember totally different types of things--verbal, visual, and auditory. That's really why I think the game will never grow old, as the sequences and significances of the things players need to remember will always be different, even though each individual card will eventually reappear. Players, especially kids, will grow better and faster at this and other memory tasks, as well."],[5.0,"I couldn't find this color in stores so I opted to buy online. I love the rosy nude color.

Sturdy/solid and made of pretty good quality materials (steel and real wood)!  With the metal framework it looks classy and is better than a lot of cheap manufactured-wood shelf units. Most of the welds are done well, but a couple of the welded pieces were just a touch out of place.  The lower basket section was pretty rusted.  The paint was chipped and missing from parts of that one metal section, but since the unit has kind of an antique/rustic look (and that part is down low with the unit setting in a dark corner), it doesn't seem to ruin the looks of it unless you look very closely.  Assembly was hindered by a couple of framework holes that were a little out of place, and with the parts being made of steel it wasn't easy to persuade them to come together.  Packaging was very beat-up, though no shipping damage to the contents was evident.  The Styrofoam chunks were crushed in several places and made an awful mess as the parts were unpackaged.  It may be a little over-priced at $183, but I guess they have to pay for the free shipping somehow."],[5.0,"My brother got one of these for me about a year ago and I use it almost daily, I bought this one as a present and the people love it.

For an initial round of clay/compound/polish and wax took me 8 hours and a sore back. But when looking at the results...unbelievable. I am so proud of the job done. What I appreciate especially is that at no point I felt like I could create any damage to my car. When cleaning the cutting pads from the compound with a brush the pad will fly away when the speed is set to 5.

I actually stumbled on this product at an Office Max store. I checked Amazon and their price was better. So I bought one and tried it. It took me less than a week to get used to the trackball and I simply fell in love with it. The fact that it has the same buttons as a regular mouse makes the transition a lot easier. Within a week, my wrist wasn't in pain anymore. So I bought a second one and I keep one at the office and the other one with my personal laptop. I love that I can use regular batteries for it (1 AA). The USB transmitter can be kept inside the battery compartment, which prevents you from misplacing it or losing it when travelling with it. I also love the range: I can control the pointer from across the room. My previous wireless mouse didn't have such a good range. For some people the range may be unimportant, but for people like me who sometimes have to facilitate presentations, a great range helps when you are not standing next to the computer. I have recommended this product to some of my friends and they also fell in love with it. I highly recommend it if you are looking to switch from a mouse to a trackball or if you are trying to replace another trackball model."],[3.0,"So I have been searching for bedding for months and the down comfortors are so expensive that i decided to just go with the down alternative.

I even skied with them for 3 hours 1 week after the injury (NOT recommended). I wouldn't recommend Dodge ball either. It is very rough on the knees. I wear the braces everyday at work and play. They are much more comfortable than others I have tried. I like the neoprene support of some other braces, but I couldn't stand wearing that thick tight neoprene for 12 hours a day.

And I am not afraid to say that this mouse takes the cake, for $20 it looks like its worth $80. The only issue i had was that the seller sent me a wireless version, but I don't mind because it works just as well. Also where you see silver on the mouse in reality it is glossy black, and the mouse looks better IRL then in the pictures. I will add on to this review in a month or so to check in.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>we recently had a baby boy so now the use of my home theater system is on the shelf for awhile.  My wife also is not into big sound so decided to try out these wireless headphones.  at first i almost sent them back because i took the easy route and hooked them into my receivers headphone jack.  The sound was terrible and there was the dreaded hissing noise you get with some wireless electronics.  before packing them up i decided to hook them up into the jacks on the TV. Difference was like night and day.  the sound quality is great and really brings out some of the background sounds and music that you typically don't notice unless you are in a movie theater.  They aren't super comfortable for long durations but that can be expected with most headphones.  these come fully recommended.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>Works good for a boy of 6 and his parents.This game is not really requiring any skills (be it game skills, memory or else).

It has the nice bracket that can mount to your bike and you have it for the road.And although the image here doesn't show it, it does have the gauge, though it isn't the most accurate gauge (not really a problem when the tire is rated for 55 to 100 PSI).Much like one other reviewer noted, the instructions on how to switch from Schrader to Presta are not very clear and should be researched before fumbling with this blasted thing for hours trying to make it work.And like the title mentions, this isn't as tiny as the MINI name implies.  When looking for a place to mount it on my bike, I am really running short on ideas.  The obvious places would interfere with pedaling.All that said, it puts air in the tire.  Slowly.  It is double action, but the throw isn't very much.  And the higher the pressure, the more difficult it is to pump.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Perfect for the gym or under a few layers for the chilly morning runs.

When I put my camera in it's carrying bag I turn the hood around backwards and it fits perfectly.

As a result, the ball head is held in place only by the friction of the main screw attachment.  I was able to tightened down the ball head to my satisfaction, although removing the ball head may now be problematic, as it just swivels without getting looser.Otherwise this ball head is excellent.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Love kingston memory, I have never had any issues with there memory for years..

Pull the blue rubber sealing ring from the bottom of the ZipLoc hand pump.  You'll find it fits perfectly onto the business end of the FreshSaver pump.  With the blue ring in place the FreshSaver pump works on both Ziploc and FresSaver bags.

Couldn's be easier... and... the price is right!  Great way to upgrade an older printer!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I bought this rack to accomodate 2 kids bikes and 2 adult bikes.  I researched bike racks extensively and was relieved when the rack arrived and appeared to be very high quality.  The hardware fittings are oversized, the frame is heavy duty, the padding where the bike frames rest are thick, molded rubber and the velcro straps are about 2inches wide with plenty of length to ensure confidence. There is not a single piece of plastic or cheap material on this bike rack.  It took about 30 minutes to assemble the rack and get it ready for hitch installation.  One glitch I found was that the threads on my rack were reversed.  While the instructions said to screw the bolt from the passenger side through the hitch, mine was clearly too loose after installation.  The rack needs to screw in TIGHT into the hitch.  Luckily I tried to screw it from the drivers side and it worked just fine.  There is minimal clearance between the two pieces once the rack is fully installed.  There is a heavy duty pin that allows for tilting the rack to access the trunk.Now the fun part begins.  Make no mistake, the first time you try to mount your bikes, plan for 45 minutes!  This is a game of Tetris, but once you figure out the right configuration for your bikes, the mounting should take no more than 10 minutes including straps. We ended up putting the 2 kids bikes first then the 2 adult bikes. (yes the kids bikes Require an extension bar.) Keep in mind, there will always be points where the bikes rub together, but you can minimize touch points by moving the pedals to the optimal position.  After that, we used knee and elbow pads as padding between the bikes.  This works like a charm!  The velcro straps allow for a variety of secure positions and we haven't scratched our bikes at all!The last part of securing the bikes includes straps.  It is recommened to strap any bike that uses an extension bar from the bike frame or tire to the bike rack directly.  This provides extra security should the extension bar fail, the bikes will still be strapped to the bike rack.  I usually wrap one long strap around the first pair of bikes securing them to the rack, and attach another strap to the second pair of bikes and rack.  The last strap I use is secured from the bike rack to the roof rack of my SUV.  This is actually a critical part of feeling secure!  This is an anti-sway strap that keeps the entire bike rack from moving too much when you hit a bump in the road or go over a train track.  Trust me, you want to buy this strap!Our first road trip with the bikes fully loaded took us across 4 hours of highway and country roads.  The bikes arrived without a scratch and my nerves were intact too.  We have used the rack now 10+ times and each time it gets easier.  Overall, I highly recommend this bike rack.  It is a very strong and sturdy extension of your vehicle.  The only drawback I see is that it doesn't fold down.  But the single post allows me to mount kids bikes, the tilt function is perfect and easy to use, the strength in design is obvious so I will accept the single drawback happily!</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>This vacuum is one of the worst vacuums I have ever purchased. The premise behind it is great, but the longevity and performance of this vacuum need vast improvement before the product is brought into the market.In addition to poor suction, you have a motor that loses a charge faster than anything I've ever owned (which includes the very first rechargable batteries and you remember how horrible those were)</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>We had a chair like this when I was a kid, only it was yellow.

I haven't had any issues sending or receiving messages and phone calls, and it's done everything I need it to do... just not as smoothly as I think it should. I decided to write a review from the perspective of someone who has had the phone long enough to know the bugs.The touch screen worked well for the first month or two, and I finally began to get used to texting on it. Unfortunately over time the phone has become less and less responsive. (And I am not hard on electronics) It still works with a little extra pressure, but this can become frustrating. The touch sensitivity is not 100% accurate either. You'd think after a year I would be used to texting on the number keypad, but the phone frequently thinks I'm typing a key across the screen. Unfortunately, it often thinks I'm hitting the clear button when my finger is a few buttons away. Also, the phone has difficulty sensing touch in some of the menus. I can push a button 10 different ways and it still won't open sometimes.I love Tracfone, and this phone has served its purpose, but I would not recommend it. I finally am getting so fed up with trying to push buttons and navigate menus that I'm getting a different Tracfone without a touch screen.What I do love about this phone is the speaker quality for both calls and the music player. I've also had very few issues with it unlocking in my pocket and making calls. The battery life is phenomenal and will last me five days to a week with moderate usage.If you're going Tracfone (which I recommend because it is so much cheaper than everyone else!) I would suggest avoiding touch screens because they are not quite up to the standard responsiveness that we are used to. If you want a lesson in patience though, this is the way to go. ;)</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Could this possibley be the future, is cloning that far away.

The Tapes have the Issue of not overlapping exactly perfectly at times, exposing the Adhesive of the Labels which can collect Debris. The Printing, occasionally, has \"drop outs\" where parts of the information are missing. Again, typical of this line of Labelers and Tapes. The Tapes can get dirty if you are not careful, so keep them in the Case when not loaded into the Labeler. I read in another Review about lack of room in the Case for Tapes. I found enough room for one of each size Tape. That's all I need. Of course, the Labeler has one Tape loaded, too. The Power Adaptor is nice as a Back Up and I've used it that way a few times, but mostly I just run on Batteries. Large Labels with Large Bold Lettering also benefit from using the Power Adaptor. I'm considering cutting the Top of the Case Off to make it easier to maneuver and use, and then using Velcro to hold it back on for Storage. A Removable Lid would have been a nice touch.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>There are lighter alternatives for water purification, but iodine is not recommended for people like me with thyroid disease, and this filter is still relatively lightweight, easy to use, and easy to share.  Water moves both while pumping up and down, and the action is smooth and easy.  I have used this at 3 different backcountry water sources so far without getting sick.The main drawback is that it's a little clumsy to both work the pump and balance the container, and I've accidentally dropped a water bottle into a creek.  It includes connectors for connecting directly to a hydration bladder, but it expects 1/4\" inner diameter tubing, and all the bladders I have found use larger diameter.  I finally found this bladder which has tubing too large, but has compatible connectors that I can make work with some extra tubing from the hardware store.  I'll be trying it out on my next trip in a couple weeks, and hopefully that will help with the clumsiness issue.  If anyone knows a better bladder to use, please leave a comment.Just a quick warning about the moral hazard of using gear like this.  When you can filter as much water as you want, it's easy to think you're safe and abandon a little caution.  I had to backtrack a half mile on my last trip because a water source I was aiming for turned out to be dried up for the season, but I passed up a perfectly good source because I still had a little water left.  A half mile isn't a big deal, but it could have been a lot worse if the distance had been longer.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>We got this so we could whip eggs into stiff peaks without getting the mixer out for 2 or 3 eggs.

I love the smell.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Primary reason I bought these is because I was looking for comfort and quality in an affordable price range, $100-$150.  Bought these for a little over $100 and have hardly taken them off since.  Comfort is a 10/10.  I can wear these literally all day and not have a headache or earache.  The only time I'm bothered is with wearing glasses, and only that after 12+ hours of wearing these nonstop.  Even then it's not bad.  I often find myself wearing these without even listening to anything, they're that comfortable.As for quality, I mostly use these for playing games and listening to music.  They sound really good with a higher volume with a good balance.  They do have an open sound, which means sound leaks out rather significantly at high volumes but you don't have an &#34;inside your own head&#34; feeling like with closed headphones, so overall a positive.  I wouldn't use these out and about but I don't think I'd wear anything but earbuds outside anyway.  Quality is very good for music, hard to judge for studio use since I just don't have as much experience with higher-end headphones since I can't afford them.  However, from the studio headphones I have used, these are at least on par and will get the job done very well.  The open &#34;leaking&#34; would be my main concern for recording using a mic, but it is easily solved by keeping the volume reasonable.Overall, very happy with my purchase and the next pair of headphones I get would be another just like these unless I have the money for something top-of-the-line.</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>I used this product to help me fight bad breath and control tartar and even fight gingivitiswell to my disappointment this has actually made my mouth worse and created a new problem, white film is peeling from my cheeksalso the tastes is awful</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>After many tries this item would only work about 1 in 5 tries.

It has pegs that fit right into holes on the litter box, and it is very secure.  The plastic is sturdy, and my cats haven't knocked it off at all.It really helps in keeping the litter in the box.  Sure, your kitty is going to bring a little out with him, but not nearly as much as he could scatter when he's digging around.My only problem is that the hood seems a little low for larger cats.  I have a great big, 20 lb male who is very tall.  He has to stoop down very low to get comfortable in there to do his business, and sometimes he ends up \"depositing\" behind the rake.  Not a big deal, cause he's a pretty easy going cat, but I think they could make this hood taller.Other than that, love it.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>My puppy didn't like it very much at first.

Now, I had enjoyed this the first time I viewed it (holy cow, can it really be 15 years ago? I'm feeling old...), but I'm well aware that it's long been fashionable in some circles to make fun of the film. But you know, I don't think it really deserves it.Oh, there's no doubt the star of the film is the ship; the screenplay itself is less than stellar. It's a bit hokey and clunky and heavy-handed, with no real subtlety or originality. But in one sense, these attributes actually work well with a story set in this era; the simple plot (with a broad portrayal of both good and evil characters) is presented in a fashion similar to how a melodrama would have been depicted back in 1912, whether on-stage or in the earliest short silent films. I found myself thinking that the script really wasn't nearly as bad as many people have made it out to be, over the intervening years since the film was first released.That said, I'm afraid that the film didn't really \"grab\" me as much this time around, as it had when I first saw it when I was a good deal younger. Maybe I'm just getting old and tired and cynical? Or, perhaps it's the fact that I'm not a big fan of any of the actors in the film, and have no interest whatsoever in the two playing the leads. I think if the film featured some acting talent about whom I was enthusiastic, who I was excited to see on the screen, I would have found the film to be considerably more riveting. As it is---eh, I'm not all that thrilled with any of the characters apart from Molly Brown, who I thought was a lot of fun in every one of her too-brief scenes.Hmmm, what can I say---I still enjoy the picture (though it's not one that I'm likely to re-watch often in its entirety) and I do recommend it. However---any film with a running time of over three hours needs to have an intermission! Sitting still that long is too hard on the butt---heh.The 3D conversion was nicely done, but not exceptional. I thought it would be a little more striking, in fact---after the first hour I kind of forgot that I was even seeing it in 3D. But, no real complaints on this score.This re-release may not set any box-office records, but after only a week in theatres it's already easily paid for the 3D conversion process and is making a tidy profit.---SLIGHT SPOILER WARNING---Oh, I do have one huge complaint---and there's probably no need to even post spoiler warnings, because doesn't everyone already know exactly what happens at the end? While I find the very end of the film most touching---haunting, even---the bit that comes before that annoys the heck out of me. I STILL am ticked off that \"old Rose\" threw the priceless blue diamond into the water! I don't care how symbolic it is---explain it any way you like, that was just a stupid and pointless and senseless thing to do to an art object that had huge historical significance. Holy cow, she could have just written out a complete account of her story and packed it up along with the gem---and then upon her death made sure her will specified that the package was delivered to the Smithsonian, or something like that. Man---even writing out these words, and I find I'm getting ticked off all over again! So, that's the one thing that I really hate about this film.Well, now that I'm thinking about the ship, I'm curious to view both the 1950's version ofTitanic(starring Barbara Stanwyck) andA Night to Remember (Criterion Collection)(also from the 1950's). I've seen both films, but it's been a while and I don't have a clear recollection of either...</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Now everybody gets an even sized wedge.Fast and easy eight section wedger.Might even work with tangerines too.Would definitely recommend.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Nicer than I expected.

The screen cover does make it a little harder to view my pictures in the direct sun.  A second problem is that dust gets between the LCD screen and the inside of the cover.  The dust requires that I remove the cover to clean it.  The answer would be for the manufacture to add a gasket to the inside of their screen protector to seal it.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>The Sony just came the other day but it was sent to us quickly, perfectly packaged, and put it together very easily.

When I got it today I looked at it and it does not have a wooden handle.The metal was good and well set in the handle but it was not wood and neither is the sheath.

Like some others, I had started buying plain carbonated water but was appalled at how quickly the empty bottles piled up.  This one fit the bill perfectly.I now charge about 1 liter a day, adding some flavorings and enjoying it quite a bit.  I start with keeping the siphon in the refrigerator, along with (Brita) filtered chilled water.  I find it's best to let it infuse at least an hour after charging but it is still effective if you want to use it immediately.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>My dogs love these treats.

Installed about a month ago and it works as advertised.  Installation is quite simple, just be careful to route the wires to avoid pinching them.  The device that is supposed to hold the lock to keep it from falling out of the door while you install it is weak.  I would suggest a little blue masking tape to hold it securely because you wouldn't want to bounce test your expensive new lock.  This is installed on the garage door.  Now I don't have to remember to bring the key to get into the garage.  I would leave it unlocked, the wife would lock it, etc.  That problem is entirely solved with this very stylish lockset.</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>It looks the same as it does on the preview, but it is really low resolution. It's like they have taken an image and resized it 10 times. Not a &#34;original&#34; poster, this is simply a print out/copy of an image. Although it does look okey from a distance, I expected it to be of a quality similar to other movie posters.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>It's cheaper online than at Fry's.

Plus Crosman and Gamo would not sell anything that would harm your airsoft, bb or pellet guns.  If they did, and it was one of their guns, still in warranty, they would have to repair it.One thing I have learned is never put the bb's that come with your air gun in your air gun, unless it is a cheap spring powered gun.  A lot of high end guns come with a cleaning rod to unplug the cheep bb's, because they are not well rounded.  Over the years I have owned quite a few and now my grandchildren own some of them.

Only thing to remember is to give it a tap & wait until you see the zeros before getting on. I have used it almost every day for a couple of years now & it still works like new. I even take it in my suitcase on trips. Although I must warn you that if you put it in your carry-on luggage, they will search your suitcase right at security. I've replaced the battery once and it was not expensive.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>A well made functional coffee maker with hot water which works great and is quick. I like the cone shaped coffee filter makes great coffee.

Firstly, this is not at all for a small newborn (8 lbs) this is clearly for a larger child maybe 3 months and older.  Secondly anything that you need the help of another person to use really isn't worth it's weight in gold!  This felt like putting on a strait jacket and then trying to figure out how to get the child in there without him suffoccating on his mothers breasts was like pulling teeth.  This may be a carrier for larger babies (we'll see in the future) but for now and a newborn, it is not worth the money nor the sweat poured after trying to get this contraption on.  Oh and yes I did try this on myself because I couldn't understand my daughter's compllints until I walked (or didn't walk) in her shoes with this thing on me and my grandson nearly suffocating to death.  We'll wait until he's about 6 months and use it for back carrying.  I purchased a carrier for myself several years ago for my son and it was awesome, wish I could remember the brand and style...this surely wasn't it.  Disappointed. 2 stars ONLY because were waiting a few months before trying ti again.  We'll be back!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Our son is obsessed with Jack the pirate.

I was about to take him to the Vet and then I stumbled upon this shampoo. I decided to try it and if it didn't work, then off to the vet we will go.. I brought my dog up to the bathroom where he immediately jumped in the tub ready for his bath. I lathered him thoroughly and just kept massaging it into his skin for 10 minutes. He just sat there, enjoying the rub down. After drying him off and letting him relax, I noticed an immediate difference in his skin. A couple days later and his scabs are almost gone and less flakes in his coat. I definitely recommend this product for a dog who has skin problems. At no more than $13, what do you have to lose? Possible a trip to the Vet.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>The more I use this, the more I LOVE IT!I have several other apple corers and slicers. They are going into the trash now!What sold me was watching the video. Still, I was suspicious.I've been fooled before by such things. NOT THIS TIME!I use this almost every day now for both apples and pears. It works PERFECTLY with very little effort.It washes well in the dishwasher too.The base (used to \"Pop\" the core and wedges)is hinged,so it can not be separated nor lost;PLUS I have found it allows me to use this slicer as a \"SERVER\"!After I \"Slice, Core and Pop\" an apple or pear,I remove the core (or sometimes NOT) and set it on the tablefor my wife and I to select the perfectly cut wedges. It is a cool SERVER!We think it looks very attractive in the way the apple or pear appears ... inviting you to take a piece.I am going to buy another one (maybe more for my daughters),because sometimes it is in the dishwasher and I want to use it again(I COULD, hand wash it, I suppose ... I'd rather buy another one).Just think, wouldn't some cold, crisp and tasty sliced apple or pear taste really great right now?You will be very happy with this \"Wedge and Pop\", believe me!UPDATE:I bought three more. I bought a spare for us, and one each for my two daughters.Caution: When unpacking take extra care. Two twist ties secure the wedge and pop to the packaging,These must be untied with your fingers quite near the very sharp blades. Don't rush and be watchful!When you are selecting the apples and pears to buy, choose ones that are as \"evenly symetrical\" as possible.If you don't (experience talking), it will be difficult to push the wedge and pop through the fruit,PLUS it will not core the fruit properly and the result will be less than ideal.STILL, all in all ... I would give the wedge and pop MORE than 5 stars, if I could!GREAT product!{Did my review help you decide?}</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>THIS WAS MY FAV OUT OF ALL TE CASES I ORDERED.

GREAT GREAT product!!!!</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>For all those giving this movie 1-2 star ratings, please understand the serious problems involved in making this thing.  The film was originally scheduled for a 2002 release but it suffered from production and serious financial problems -- the company went bankrupt during post-production. I'm guessing they HAD to slap together something and get it released to make enough money just to pay off all the lawyers.The \"cheesy\" CGI was of the quality found in big-budget TV sci-fi shows of that time (like Star Trek Voyager). The post-production team probably could not afford to buy high-end \"Jurassic Park\" type CGI for a B-movie. The CGI renditions they used are passable on a TV-size screen but come off as absolutely horrid on a 40 foot screen. I suspect this is why much of the film was shot in low-light environments -- don't have to show as much detail.As noted by many, the film also suffered from terrible scripting; don't blame the actors, they have to work with what's placed in front of them.Remember, the movie was based on a Ray Bradbury sci-fi short story written in the 1950's -- long before much was known about how dinosaurs became extinct, or the fact that the Earth suffered numerous mass-extinctions throughout its history. The whole \"butterfly effect\" is absurdly ridiculous especially given the fact the plot has a pyroclastic flow from an erupting volcano wiping out all the local life anyway. Nor can we ignore the giant comet / meteor that wiped out some 90% of all life on the planet 65-million years ago (that probably was not known as a scientific fact when Bradbury wrote the story).Did it ever occur to anyone that maybe the butterfly was SUPPOSED to die and that the \"time-wave\" events depicted in the movie ,in fact, showed the correct version of evolution? Maybe it was Homo Sapiens (and all other primates) who shouldn't be here today? Maybe it was the highly-evolved simian-reptiles who actually made the first journey back to the Jurassic tar-pit and THEY were the ones who screwed everything up in the first place?Never the less, I gave the movie a charitable 3-star rating. Suitable for kids cooped up in the house on a rainy Saturday afternoon or a dorm room beer party. Cheap entertainment, just avoid thinking while viewing and you'll be o.k. Good B-movie sci-fi fun.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This switch is built like a tank and running just fine, unlike the part it replaces.

The top edges are simply straight up making it difficult to grasp expecially when full of hot food.3: covers of each container are not pyrex, but thin plastic.  The original pyrex containers always also came with Pyrex lids.So there is a trade-off in the low cost.

My son loves the way they feel and even said they make his hands look cool lol. He could also easily put these on and strap them himself without any help. For a 5 year old, my son is kind of average build but tall and skinny so these are a great fit. These gloves do stretch some to accomodate larger fingers, but I don't know how comfortable that would be for the kid.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Now I think I have all the chargers I or my wife need, until another one gets lost.

Unlike the other customers, I bought this telescope at a local store with a 2-year warranty. Thus, the telescope was unbroken and packaged properly. The instruction manual was detailed and the telescope came with a software known as theSky, which is a useful program that allows you to locate celestial bodies at the place and time which you are at.The telescope itself is a sturdy unit, and was properly collimated. With its 127mm aperture, I could easily view planets, stars, and also the moon with great ease. The telescope mount is german equatorial, which was useful as it allows you to track down the star you want to find in the night sky by countering the earth's rotation. As this type of mounting also causes the telescope to move in a slow motion, it is easier to pinpoint a star as compared to an alt-azimuth mount.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>The hardware works very well, and the fact that it's solid-state is a huge bonus since my drive get's a lot of travel time. The battery life is great! Oh, did I mention that it has a battery?!? The problem lies in the software. If Toshiba put half as much time into developing the software as they did the hardware, this would be an amazing portable drive. The Android app simply does not work for me (Samsung Note 3). It crashes each time I try to use it, so I could not even test it to see what kinds of features it has. The PC interface is not great, but it works. I really hope Toshiba spends some time fixing the software-side of this product, because if/when they do it will be absolutely worth having.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I received this product complementary from Influenster and absolutely love these pens! The pens flow smoothly and write with an ease. I am a picky person when it comes to picking out a pen to use and this pen meets all of my expectations for a pen.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I'm a software engineer, and I spend 90% of my time typing.  I ordered this when my wrist pain was at its worst, due to my continual typing day in and day out.  When the item came, it looked a little smaller than I expected, but it fit my wrist comfortably.  This being small actually turned out to be an advantage; I could easily remove it when I'm not typing and stash it into my pocket until I need it again.After about few weeks of use, my wrist pain subsided substantially.  And I've been using this for almost a year now, and the pain is completely gone!The only issue with this is that, after many days of use, it starts picking up bad oder.  So you need to wash it well every now and then.  I just throw it into my washing machine every now and then when it starts smelling bad.  That seems to do the trick.All in all, I'm very happy with this product.</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>I ordered the one shown here with Aloe and Vitamin E.

I first tried Nizoral 1% shampoo but it did nothing for me.  Then I tried Neutrogena T-Gel and it didn't do enough.  T-Sal is the strongest medicinal shampoo you can buy for scalp dermatitis that I know of.  You must use a lot of the shampoo and lather it up and leave it on your scalp for at least 5 minutes for maximum benefit.  Also do not forget to also use the shampoo around your ears, your neck and your forehead as the skin there may also be affected by the dermatitis.  I bought the 5 bottle package and I have already used the first bottle in little over a month.  I plan to continue to use this shampoo as I have noticed an improvement in my scalp problems.  This shampoo is only for those who suffer from seborrhea and psoriasis of the scalp and other dermatitis.  You do not need it for regular dandruff.  If you have normal dandruff, get Head and Shoulders.  T-Sal is for more than just dandruff.  I use a Pantene anti-breakage conditioner after I use this shampoo.  It seems to help my hair look more normal after medicating with the T-Sal shampoo.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>These bags are perfect for my purposes and were cheaper than bags I purchased from another site before I thought to look on Amazon.

Name \"SteamVac\" is very misleading because there is no steam or heater in it. I read the reviews before buying so I wasn't expecting any \"steam\" or \"heater\". During first use the brush block jammed and broke and Hoover replaced it with new one in about a month (reason for 4 star) and since then its working great. Since I use this cleaner almost every week, I use VERY hot water and very little or no cleaning chemical.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I make a lot of hand pies and this gem has made it an easy task. It is well made with metal hinges, unlike a lot of it's competitors. Folded out flat, it will cut out the perfect sized circle for your pie.  It does a great job of crimping and sealing the edges. If you make a lot of empanadas, dumplings or handpies, this tool is for you. NOTE:  This makes a decent sized pie, not a small dumpling sized one.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I put it into a standard light fixture with a glass ball over it to diffuse the light.

Enjoy a world where light makes a difference!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>These cabinet & drawer locks are terrific. I have 5 kids and installed them when my youngest started crawling. They are a godsend. My favorite part is that you can disengage them after the baby goes to bed. Or even better, you don't have to uninstall them when your child grows older. You can just put them in the \"off\" position. Then if you have company over with small children, one flip of the red switch on each lock and you are child proofed again! Highly recommended!Kristine</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Great little white balance cards, but much overpriced. Lanyard is too large and unnecessary.

The Coleman cooler was exactly as described, although I'm not that sure 24 cans will fit inside.  Doesn't look quite large enough, but is great for the beach or tailgaiting.  I was not disappointed and neither was he.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Met all expectations and provided cover I was looking for. Switch plate cover could not be found at box stores or at any other local electrical or hardware stores.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I agree with all of the high praise and positive observations about this beautiful knife. Big..yes...really too big to carry in a pants pocket. I carry mine in a nylon sheath horizontal on my belt. Materials are top notch. Fit and finish are excellent. I love the squared off corners and feel of the handle. I have been collecting and carrying folding knives for 30+ years,and sometimes I feel like I have paid too much for a knife, but not this time. The lines of the handle and blade are mated perfectly. The overall look and feel of this knife equal a magnificent execution of an implressive design.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This is the best coffee maker I've ever had.  It's fast, quiet, and the coffee is hot (no more preheating the cup).  It has a 30 min shutoff. The stainless pot means no fear of breakage.There is NO PROBLEM of dribbling spout as mentioned in previous reviews. Maybe Cuisinart redesigned it after the feedback. The spout sticks out 5/8\" and pours perfectly.I wouldn't hesitate to buy this again.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I used TRX in the gym and I was looking to buy one for my home use and for travels. I read the reviews and honestly chose this one for its price. I was very surprised by the quality of this piece when I received it. I have been using Jungle Gym for almost a month and  I could not find any drawback. The design of the arm grips and foot cradles makes it much more comfortable for extensive use.I'd recommend Jungle Gym for anyone who's been looking for a suspension trainer.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>This item has a great construction.

Very clear display, clear feature set and clear feature set along with smooth setting. As long as you have the correct setup info(VoIP server, account and password), setup would be easy! Hope to have more chance to try other Yealink Product!

The water heats up so much faster than my old stove top kettle. My only concern, and the reason for only giving it 4 stars, is that I have noticed some rusty calcium build up showing up where the handle meets the body of the kettle. Initially I was using tap water, but switched to using Sparkletts after about a week. So i don't know if this was caused by the tap water and I just didn't notice or if it is in fact a defect. Unfortunatetly I noticed the problem a little too late to return it, but so far it hasn't affected its perfomance. Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase given the reasonable price.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>At first I thought this product was not that good, but then I found the markers do work well once I do the following:1. Turn the markers upside down, and store in a cup so they stay upside down.2. Lightly dampen the tip of a marker before using it the first time.3. Press the tip down on a surface firmly for several seconds, release, press again. Then the ink will start to flow.4. Colors are vibrant enough to suit me when I turn on the light board.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I have not had a good camera since my early 20's when I managed to lose my Canon AE-1 with several lenses, flash etc. in Jamaica. Life and kids has regulated me to digital cameras of the point and shoot variety until now. I did tons of research online, consulted with several Photography types, and came up with the FujiFilm X series. I settled on the X-E1 over the X-M1 for the viewfinder and not the X-Pro1 due to size and cost.This camera is the most pleasant to operate of any camera I have seen since cameras went digital. You want to set Aperture? Roll the ring on the lens, just like you did with a film camera. Shutter speed? Dial on top again like a film camera. There are no 'Mode' dials anywhere to be found, on 'Sports, Mountain, Birthday cake settings' . just plain simple controls. If you want the shutter speed to be automatic, set it to A, same with Aperture.If you want more, there are tons of options in the menu system, but most photo enthusiasts will just ignore these.The image sensor is fantastic, providing image quality on par with the very best DSLR's out there, even full frame. Within 30 minutes of owning the X-E1, I took the best pictures I ever have, and even more important my wife was able to reproduce the same results. A lot of this was also due to the 35mm f1.4 lens, but the simplicity of the camera and it's high quality sensor round out the picture.The build quality is top notch, with all the dials and buttons having great feel and positive feedback.The owners manual is a bit small so I downloaded the .pdf from Fuji's web site and loaded it into iBooks, now I just read it on the iPad, so size problem solved.This will be, I believe, my camera of choice for many years to come.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>You never really appreciate these things until you try them. Sitting in bed reading, it is difficult finding a comfortable position for my legs. One ankle on top of the other knee... straight out... both bent...just wasn't working. Using one of these in physical therapy, I found it highly comfortable and my legs weren't at all restless like they are in the sitting on a flat bed position. This particular wedge has three different angles/heights you can use. I don't see how anyone would say that it is too big, unless they are a &#34;small person&#34;... like 3' high. The shortest height/angle is only about 9&#34; high. I use the short side on my upper legs and the long side for my lower legs (opposite of the photo above). I am medium height but have a long torso and short legs for my height. It is only about 2&#34; wide, so it is not this &#34;huge&#34; thing on my bed. This is really going to help with my back and leg comfort as well. I only gave 4 stars because the it seems a bit soft - not sturdy enough to hold up to usage - and the cover isn't really a cover, but a &#34;pre-cover&#34; - very thin undercover, really should have something else to protect it.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>It was pretty good. What was there was pretty truthfull, there just wasn't anything really knew for me.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I've bought 2 of these. They are sturdy, have a wonderful finish, and have fit on every door I've tried them on. They are heftily made.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I love my Gigaset phones which I've had for years and needed a new battery for one of the phones and found it here</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>When I showed them to our chef he couldn't tell the difference in the Reflections and real silver until he felt the weight! Great product!</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>This is a great DVD transfer of the non-stop special effects of Alien vs Predator (AVP). Enjoying even the great special effects of this film isn't enough to make for a really memorable sci-fi experience as it takes an engaging plot to make a good film, even in science-fiction.I don't believe anyone would think of this movie as part of the Alien series or try to compare it with prior Alien films. It obviously represents a \"knock off\" intended to attract from a large number of satisfied customers of the Alien vs Predator magazines. This doesn't mean that it shouldn't be considered good sci-fi film and I purchased the DVD hoping for a satisfying film experience.The story line does a nice job of connecting the film histories of the Alien and Predator races together and linking these two fictional accounts with the history of man on earth in a plausible way. Most people agree that the history of ancient monuments all over the earth appear to have a common link, which is probably one of the sources of the Atlantis myth.If anything I think AVP attempted to recapture the action and line up of good characters from ALIENS. Also, rather than the one-on-one bug hunt of the original film, this movie was about war between a defacto army of humans against an army of Alien creatures and their very dangerous Queen.In terms of special effects I would give this movie four stars, however, I couldn't get all that interested in the basic story and AVP left me with an overall one to two star impression and the feeling I was watching an animated comic book.I must admit that I never had the large screen theater experience and first saw the film on DVD at home. I assumed I would at least like AVP since I own the entire Alien series on DVD and enjoy seeing every one of them over and over again. However, I did find it worth watching and am looking forward to purchasing \"Alien vs Predator Requiem\"</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Build is very cheap but it needs to be so there is not a ton of extra weight on the camera.  You plug it in and it works perfect.  Great product!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I bought the TG3 primarily because of the ruggedization, GPS, Compass and Wi-Fi.  It also promised superior low-light perfomance. I have a couple of nice Nikon DSLR cameras but I don't like taking them in wet environments, and they are heavy. Received the TG3 yesterday and have tried it in all modes, including Wi-Fi in both iOS and Android with the Olympus Image Share Ap. Great images so far. The TG3 will fit in a large pocket and it is not as heavy as a DSLR so I will use it as a secondary camera. I have not tried it underwater and I will probably not do a drop test from seven feet. I need to study low light performance in more detail but it seems to work well. I will post some of my first photos on Flickr under VMI63 in an album labeled Olympus TG3.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I love all of the &#34;Bourne&#34; movies.

Leather feels good and overall case build is good except for the folding stand. The stand only works if you don't touch it. There is nothing to hold the phone if you touch it so don't buy this case if you want to use it as a stand.The 1520 phone is already large so overall this case doesn't add much to the overall size. There is nothing to hold the LCD cover in place, this is dangerous if you drop the phone the chances are high that the cover will not stay in place to protect the phone.</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>Contrary to what the picture on the labels implies, there aren't any meowing, cuddly kitten inside these cans!

The fact that it has a slot for MicroSD cards built right into the side.Great card reader.  I don't see why anyone would want a card reader on the front of their computer.  This sits on my desk and isn't in the way.  It's perfect.Thanks Amazon and IOGear!</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>There are no holes drilled in the sides of this box only in the back, if I planned to mount it on the wall it would be perfect, but I want to recess the unit so I will have to modify the box and hope it does not void my warranty.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This Iphone case is fantastic. I just recieved it today and it is one of my favorite cases and I have quite a few. The color of the ribbon is more of a pink, pink then a baby pink. In the picture the pink color is lighter but when I received it it was slightly darker. I totally don't mind, I honestly love the actual color even better. The rhinestones have not fallen off yet and when I opened the package they were all still firmly glued on. The time it took to ship was longer than I hoped but it did come 5 days earlier that the estimated shipping arrival. I absolutley loved this case and I would definitely recommend this purchase and using this seller.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>It is just the handiest and coolest thing to have in your bag for all kinds of emergencies that may arise.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Good deal for the money,if you know what to expect when you make your order and you know how to set up and use these speakers properly.

Should have paid more attention to negative reviews.Camera worked fine for exactly one day. Picture quality was outstanding.  By day two, functions stopped working and by day 3 it was useless, despite never taking deeper than a few feet, not dropping it, cleaning it per instructions, etc.I believe Panasonic has a serious quality control issue or a failed design issue.  No water visible anywhere inside the camera at any point but screen started blinking off and on every second, then video mode stopped working, followed by all menus failing to work, etc.  As stated, this camera takes a great picture, but it's got to work to do it and it obviously didn't.  Fortunately, we had several other regular cameras with us or just having this one would have been a real bust for pictures of our vacation.If Panasonic can fix whatever is causing these cameras to fail at a high rate, I would love to have it - but not as is.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>very good full in vitamin c i like the taste in my milk or smothies plus l use it for my mask with milk n aotmeal n is very good full in vitamin c it helps my to my face.</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>Other reviews suggest that the unit does what it is supposed to do..

Even the amazon part number is deceptive \"ASIN: B0016IUXTS\" you think that just maybe the kit is all 16 bolts which are required to bolt on the transmission pan.Buyer be ware - thought I would never have to say that about amazon - sorry I had to.</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>I suppose it depends on what you are using this for. I wanted it to be able to seethe size # on sewing machine needles. It does not work for me. This is not the firstmagnifier I have purchased, for the purpose I want it for. No luck yet.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Flaws and all, this is one classic film, something for the time capsule. It's got it ALL, baby.Let's start with Rob Lowe. Jerry McGuire he ain't. You're never going to see Rob with tears streaming down his cheeks, telling a woman that she \"completes\" him. Rather, you're more likely to find him yanking his clothes out of the closet, pulling out any photos that include him, stuffing it all in a duffel bag and hurling it into a garbage truck as he leaves the former object of his desire alone and naked in bed...just like the opening minutes of \"Bad Influence.\"And yes, I know Rob has taken some \"serious\" roles and has played the \"good guy\" on occasion, but my challenge to you is \"NAME one of those roles.\" I remembered them at the time, and I've forgotten them, pretty much like every other Rob Lowe fan on the planet. We want Evil Rob, and this movie is Pure Evil Rob.I won't offer any spoilers here, but let's just say that if you can't see the major plot twist coming from a mile away, you haven't seen too many movies.James Spader seems like an odd choice to play Lowe's \"good\" doppelganger, the guy who becomes corrupted as Rob introduces him to his own wants and desires. Spader's starred in more than his fair share of \"this guy makes me feel kind of squirmy\" roles. Of course, the only way the corruption of the character's \"innocence\" can appear real is that if it's built on shaky foundations to begin with, and Spader nails it. His character is a \"career guy,\" a \"ladder climber,\" engaged to Marcia Cross, who equally nails the boring, white bread, \"why am I marrying this woman\" object of Spader's luke-warm desire. See, Spader really doesn't want the pot of gold at the end of his rainbow. He wants to ride around in  sporty little car with Evil Rob Lowe and do evil things. And he does. Why do you think the movie is named \"Bad Influence\" instead of \"Two Nice Guys Helping Others?\"The soundtrack is lip-smackin' 80s dee-licious, too. Lots of synthy angst...a highlight being The Nymphs performing \"The Highway\" during Lowe and Spader's first venture into one of the sleazy \"password at the door\" clubs. According to the notes on the YouTube clip of this scene, \"Inger Lorre wrote this song about Richard Ramirez, the \"Night Stalker,\" and the groupies he attracted during his trial.\" Makes it a perfect choice for this movie.I could go on...in detail...but I'm keeping my \"no spoilers\" promise. You probably have a general idea of what this one is all about, and I've tried to convey the flavor without ruining the experience. I love it, I've watched it at least 100 times since its release...it's a \"midnight movie,\" it's sublime junk, it's a career high for Lowe. He plays his character with such oily, unrepentant glee that you envy anyone having that much fun and getting paid for it.

I felt it was a nice addition to my workouts until it broke.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Husband prefers this brand of nasal cannula, happy to find it on Amazon, it has soft flexible tubing therefore more comfortable than other brands.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>I keep guppies, blue rams and about 30 sakura red cherry shrimp in a 29 gallon tank. This is one of the foods I rotate through. The tank gets about two large pinches when I feed, and they get this particular food about once a week (I also feed brine shrimp, flake, blood worms, algae wafers and more).The fish gobble this up quickly. I have never seen a shrimp be able to eat one before all the guppies hoover the little pellets up. The pellets/pieces are medium sized... a bit too big for fry under 2-3 weeks old.The container label lists the ingredients as: \"Fish meal, krill, corn meal, squid meal, wheat flour, earthworm meal, dried spirulina algae, wheat gluten meal, dried seaweed meal, dried yeast, squid liver meal, dicalcium phosphate, calcium carbonate, dried mango...\" it goes on for awhile. I'm not entirely happy about seeing so much grain in the food mix. The container also says to feed as much in a day as the shrimp can eat in 2 hours.The expiration date is for 6/14. Being that I bought this about two months ago, it has roughly a 2 year shelf life. Good enough.All in all, I might not buy this again. The guy I bought my shrimp from said to just give them algae wafers every so often, and a bit of scallop once in a while as a treat. I don't think the shrimp will miss this. The guppies probably won't either. If I was keeping only shrimp I would buy it again, just to give the little guys some variety in their diet.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>This air hose is a very good product at a good price...A little stiff on recoil but very functional...I am satisfied with it's performance...</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>IT WAS A PERFECT MATCH FOR MY CAR.

Unit was easy to assemble, I have read other reviews on this unit by people who must not have known which end of the screw driver to hold. My wife helped me hold pieces in place and we had it together in 20 minutes.While I wouldn't call it comfy enough to watch a movie on it is an attractive piece and makes for a nice place to sit for awhile if you're looking for a quiet retreat.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Very, very low-end polymer but actually the best mag carrier I've every used. I got two for the proper rig. Getting them on your belt is a bit of a pain. I use a Wilderness Instructor Belt and the webbing is a tad wider than the pouch is cut for. Makes it more secure  and I'm not in any hurry when I don my gear. Get two.</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>WOW!  What a disappointment.  I should have listened to the 1 star reviews.  This is a movie in search of a script.  I figured with Arkin and Falk it would have the same chemistry as \"The In-laws\" but it never gets off the ground.  It starts out like a parody of \"Double Indemnity\" and then goes haywire.  It could have been a screwball comedy but goes off in too many directions and just falls flat.  I gave it 2 stars because Arkin and Falk do some good acting, too bad they didn't have a good script.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>The price was great, nice colors.  Can't have too many stylus's.

The supposed capacity was around 75 lbs., and so I purchased it to carry my twins' car seats (about 25 lbs. ea.) through the airport.  Getting to the plane was no problem, but as we deplaned and made our way through Midway airport in Chicago, it began to shed pieces and the platform no longer stayed at 90 degrees.  Also, I'm 5'10&#34;, and found the handle about 6&#34; too short; I had to stoop a little to hold it.When we got back home, this cart went back, as well.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Easy to set up...even for computer challenged :0) no fail and multiple deviceCapability.

My sister was thirteen then. We took off the wrapper and the green gum taunted my taste-buds. We melted. I took out a piece and could smell it from two feet away. I have a good nose. I took off the wrapper and ever so gently put it in my mouth. I loved the taste!This gum has a green and silver package, also a silver wrapper. This gum has a very good texture; it is soft, actually chewable and delicious! As most already know this gum, as well as most gum, makes your breath smell good. Also it curves your hunger! It is also is very kid-friendly, great for the little ones.I love the flavor of this gum. Sweet mint is so delectable. Also I love this gum because it smells appetizing. I love how this gum last a long time. Another good thing about this gum is that it is sugar-free. This gum also lasts for around twenty minutes. This gum taste like ice-cream, but less cold. I love almost everything about this gum.Remember how I said ALMOST, the only thing I detest is how fast the flavor runs out after twenty minutes. That is just not long enough for me. It is better than nothing. Your spit affects your outcome. I mostly love this product!Kids love this, adults too! Gum chewers of all ages will love the sweetness of mint. People who seek flavor will seek this product. Mint lovers will fall in love. Ice-cream cravers who don't like the cold will crave this gum. Also this is good for women on diets.I've told you about my experience with the gum.  I've also told you about who may like it. Now go out and try it for yourselves! Go on now it is time to leave the nest!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>For the price, this phone case was great. It was gorgeous, I loved the design.

However, the strong smell is really a problem.  My opened it for days and hoped the smell would disappear.  It seemed disappeared a little, so I put my blanket in it.  After a few days, I opened the bag and I took out my blanket.  My blanket smelled just like the bag.  I was sad and returned the bags.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>I ordered this item because it is so adorable and I have a couple other charms from the same collection (and I love them all). The charm is very cute and looks great on my phone. My only complaint is that there are a couple paint flaws around the face. It looks like some of the white paint got smeared during production and left a white blotch under the left eye. However, I doubt that it is a common issue with the item as the other pokemon time charms I have all came out perfectly.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I bought these so I could have some ANSI rated glasses/sunglasses that would fit my ESS Rx insert.

It's a shame they gave up on it, and thought that the wireless web abilities in my cell phone was a replacement.  This is anything but the truth.  The Palm VII could get email, news, weather, taxi cabs, book hotels, lookup information in an online dictionary or encyclopedia, and do so much more.  The advantage was that these things could be done within seconds while driving down the highway, in the forest or wherever you were at.  I used this thing very heavily when I was on a vacation in Florida and did so much that would take forever to accomplish with a GPS, cell phone or device with a web browser.  The Palm VII lacked a browser because they are slow and take forever to get information over a device like this.So sad they had to discontinue Palm.net and so sad that the majority of people out there are so ignorant.  This device never caught on with the public.  But it will be forever remembered.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>No more waiting!

I think it is pretty cool.You can't turn furby off but you can put him to sleep. Put furby to sleep by leaving him in a dark room unattended for two minutes. Feed furby by putting your finger in his mouth and pushing on his tongue or you can feed him with the furby app.It is best to put rechargeable batteries in furby because he uses them quickly.All furbys are for ages 5 years and up. But some furbys might be better for younger children as furbys are all different colours and textures. For example, a white furby might be better for a young child and a black one for an older child because white furbys have longer fur and also they look a little different than black furbys.Furbys can change their personality suddenly. They might be a rock star personality and then they might close their eyes and move them quickly so it looks kind of like they are having a seizure and start saying '' me change '' and when they open their eyes and they are a valley girl!!!!!Furbys are AMAZING toys overall though.</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>This drive arrived dead on arrival - not even a hum ...

Every once in a while, when the itch to \"live large\" needs a scratch, hey, get the band back together and hit the road for another \"greatest hits\" tour, supporting another \"greatest hits\" album.Well, all was fine and good until digital media upset the Apple cart. Now with the kids sharing their Bit-Torrent files across the web in their iTunes programs, nobody's selling units anymore. And every pimply teen with an iPad has every greatest hits compilation you could ever make. Now the only time the gravy train rolls into the station for elderly and burned out artists is a new tour. Watching these codgers drag themselves across the stage at your local highly-flammible nightclub borders on the inhumane. Instead of treasuring the music of your childhood, now you have to see it fumbled out from the arthritic fingers of your idols of yesteryear.This is all to give a little background to the sad story of REM and their latest merchandising play. While branching out like this is an ingenious way to avoid leaving the house (getting prescription refills for your hypertension and high cholesterol is such a pain on tour! And forget about dealing with the insurance coverage), I have to say that branding a nose hair remover with the previously solid \"Alternative\" brand of REM might have been a mis-step. I am sure that the band members love the product (when you get old, hair comes out of your nose, ears and other unexpected holes) but maybe they could have held out for a classier product- I mean, even that rapist Vince guy has the Slap Chop.Anyway, I'm sure the REM Nose Hair Pulling Spring is great; but don't expect it to bring you back to the magic teen years like listening to \"Document\" does.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This is an amazing case! It does exactly what it claims and retains all functionality. The product is good and shipped exactly when it was originally estimated.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>This tower was relatively simple to assemble.  Not the heavy duty model you find at the Gym, however for the money and home gym, it certainly seems solid enough.  I go about 185, and my son is 210.  It supports both of us fine and does not wobble.I would recommend this product for individuals under say 285.  I think it is rated to 250, but am confident it would support more.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Great wireless printer, prints from our cell phones and laptops. Only complaints are that setting up an Ad-Hoc network is NOT easy and the printer turns the wifi off when you haven't used it for a while. I'm sure there is a setting for this, but it's not easy to find.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Well &#34;Joe&#34; made it home for the holidays, he's exactly as shown... he's a 12 inch doll and looks very sharp.</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>I don't review often, but when a product is so bad, and especially when a product is so disappointing compared to my expectations, I feel it's necessary to warn others.  I am generally a fan of Logitech products, and when I went looking for a quality headset for my laptop, I bought this headset with confidence.  And I loved it for about 3 uses before the USB connector buckled after I brushed it against the arm of my chair.  I don't believe I've ever seen a USB connector this poorly constructed.  Standard construction is very durable, and Logitech must have really been cutting costs with this design.  It makes me wonder if Logitech is now just phoning in their product designs, coasting on their reputation.  Sad.  Logitech lost a loyal customer with this one.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I absolutely love this bedspread! The size is awesome. Most are way too short all the way around for a kingsize bed but this one fits great! It's even longer than I really need but that's better then too short! I am very pleased with this purchase! The color is perfect; more of an aqua which is really what I was hoping for rather than green that the picture shows. Thanks!!</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>this seems to help!

I use this for my external battery charger and the length is just right.</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>Cheap glass, don't buy. Takes forever to ship, and the glass is not gorilla glass or oem. It's a knock off.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>There is one thin compartment on one side of this case into which you slide the GPS unit.  This is excellent protection and ensures your screen remains pristine.  On the other side of this case is a larger compartment which holds the other accessories, like the cables, the charging unit, and the gimble assembly used to attach the unit to the windshield or dash.  It makes for a very tidy small package that keeps all the necessary stuff in one place, plus it's a quality pouch that reflects the name of Garmin!</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>As I write, Kansas City just got hammered with snow.  Our area (SW WI) received approx 5 inches.  I ordered this last week & it arrived on Tuesday.  Excellent packaging.  I am not &#34;mechanically inclined&#34; but I had the machine unpacked and running in about 10 minutes.  Very simple.Used it for the first time and it did a great job.  Throws the snow pretty far.  The chute stayed in place.  I just had to watch out for the extension cord.The snow was heavy but not wet-that's why I went 4 instead of 5 stars-hasn't been &#34;battle tested.&#34;  If I can use it-you can use it.  Great little machine.  Better value than the &#34;$400&#34; gas monster on clearance at the lumber store.Highly recommended.  Love it.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Ordered this to match the Danze Parma shower fixture in our guest bath. Matches nicely - cohesive look. Our plumber installed it without incident (that I know of). Looks and works great. Feels solid in your hand when you turn it on and off. It was so much easier and cheaper to order from this site than it was to get it at Home Depot, who I believe actually makes this. Ironic.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>I got this after having such a hassle loading the bobbin on my old, inherited sewing machine. It was &#34; portable&#34; for its time weighing in a light 40 pds. I nearly threw a disk in my back dragging it out to sew. I eventually became so fed up, I stopped sewing. My daughter recently jumped on the sewing band wagon I had been searching for a replacement for a while when this happen to go on Black Friday sale. I was super excited that it had the self loading bobbin.I love that the machine is light weight! I can pick it up with one hand!I also love the bobbin and self threading needle feature- what a time saver!My 9 yr old already has the hang of doing everything herself, which is awesome!My only complaint is the thread bunches up under the fabric sometimes while sewing. Its a minor inconvenience, but maybe it has to do with the type of thread. I am really happy with this machine and glad I bought it.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Perfect fit for My 2009 Altima , easy to install. Three is a you tube video that shows how to install.  A few more words.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>The Tire Pressure Monitoring System is a great idea. While some newer cars have something like this built in, it's great for older cars and would be ideal for an RV or trailer to prevent any issues on a long trip. The car on which I've used the system has steel valve stems, so I haven't had any issues with losing air pressure or damage to the valves.The thing I liked the least was the installation. There is no way I could have figured out how to install the system from the documentation supplied. I had to get help from someone who is very familiar with the set up of electronics, such as navigation systems, and even he had to muddle through to figure out how to complete the set up due to the poor documentation. One issue we had is that one of the tires we wanted to monitor was already low in pressure and the system wouldn't pick that tire up during the set up.I like the design of the system itself. The monitor can be closed while driving, and then the driver only needs to worry about it if the green light changes to yellow or red. When the car is stopped, the screen can be reviewed to view the details on whatever problem is being detected. In addition, the monitor will sound an alarm for any of the \"red\" warnings.I have found it to be a useful system and would definitely find it useful for an RV or if hauling a trailer. (Note:  The manual says in some cases a \"repeater\" accessory is needed if a vehicle is over a certain length or something is being towed.)</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>works well on my kayak and has decent sound for the size</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>this ONLY catches large debris.  I use it while running the pool vacuum and found that if I place a knee high hose inside, it will catch the majority of debris.  This way, I'm not having to stop and clean the filter so often.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Good quality, and I love the color !</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Excellent little tool for finishing up used brass.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I've read a lot of reviews on this turntable that range from &#34;Excellent!&#34; to &#34;Not nearly as good as my pure analog model blah, blah, blah...&#34;  I'm definitely in the &#34;Excellent!&#34; crowd.  I'm not an audiophile and don't have a Technics 1200 to compare it to, but I do have ears and eyes and hands.  First of all, this unit looks good.  I may be biased because I've wanted a new turntable for over a year and I chose the AT-LP120 very early on in my research, but it does look nice.  I have a couple of friends that DO have the 1200MK2, and they like this turntable.  One of them purchased a 120 to use every day and... because it has the USB out.  He calls it a 1200 clone.  Second, if you pick it up, you'll feel the substantial weight which undoubtably lends to it's steadiness and (so far) unwaivering spin rate.  My old turntable, a Technic SA-202 I've had since 1982, has served me well and still serves as the party starter in the garage (next to the bar and milk crates full of records).  Had to move it down there when the other TT crapped out over 5 years ago, so you can see I really needed a new living room unit.  And of course sound wise, the new AT-LP120 does not dissapoint.  But again, maybe my opinion is biased, because I just love to play an album.  I like sliding out the liner, then the record, smell of the vinyl, slight static that raises the hair on my arms, using the discwasher, then placing the arm manually and hearing that &#34;thump&#34; as the needle settles into the groove.  Then sitting back and listening to a whole side, where I'm not clamoring to find a new song or jumping ahead with a touch screen &#34;click&#34;, is much more enjoyable. You could buy this turntable because it's a good deal, really, for what I paid for the 202 in 1982 (just over $200) you can have a greatly superior model.  But if you're like me, you'll buy it for the experience, it can't be beat.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I have used this brand for several years and highly recommend them.

I had to cover up the holes on the sides of the pots with some white duct tape to keep the sandy soil from washing out, and also line the bottom of the pot with a layer of sphagnum moss since there are so many holes in the bottom, but other than that, it seems to be working out great so far.  I wanted something white so it wouldn't heat up as much in the sun, and I can fit two rows of these pots side by side under my fluorescent grow lights when I need to bring the plants inside over the winter to keep them from freezing.  I just ordered a second batch of them so I can finish transplanting the rest of my flytraps.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This film is an excellent introduction to the history of the Palestine Israeli struggle.  It is the historical information that most United States citizens are unfamiliar with that ultimately determines where justice lies (just as it did in South Africa and in the American south) and makes the current situation so obviously fascist.  This must stand as basic essential information and arguments over details can only be secondary.  This should be shown in every high school in America.  Bush's rhetoric about honoring UN resolutions is also shown to be just  so much more deceit from the US leadership...</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>at first start up i thought crap the pipes are loud(compaired to stock),.but after a few trips they are awesome. really nice deep idle for a 883..chrome is great ..straight bolt on no issues</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I recommend this product to anybody who has an ES-339 or an Ultra 339.

Automatic worldwide voltage.  I've been recharging every 7 to 10 days.  On/off button easy to press.The packaging was horrible, a welded clamshell.  Used a box cutter, scratched a finger while pulling it out.  It takes some effort to attach and remove the charging cord.  Charging cord is not coiled.  The wall plug is ok, not as big as others I've had.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I have been woodworking for 2 years and I purchased a grizzly 6'' jointer about 6-8 months after I started woodworking and I always had problems trying to set the straight blade height correctly, which got old very quick so I bit the bullet and purchased the byrd cutterhead. It took me about 4 hours to install and align to outfeed table and let me tell you WOW I don't have to wear earplugs it is so quite and what a awesome cut on any wood. Know I don't have to worry about setting blades,just unscrew turn 90 degrees and screw back in and the jointer is ready to go. I also purchased new bearings just in case but had no problem with the old ones since the machine was only 1 1/2 yrs. old, if you don't have anything to pull the bearings off with go to autozone as the rent pulley pullers which work great to pull off the pulley and bearings. I am now saving up to put a byrd cutterhead on my planer</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>I wouldn't purchase these again nor would I recommend them to someone. I used them a few times in weather that wasn't extreme cold and they did very little to keep my fingers warm. I have a form of Raynaud's disease and I was hoping these gloves would help to ride in the spring and fall. When these Firstgear heated gloves failed to work I went out and purchased Harley-Davidson's Women's Dual-Source Heated Gloves (Part Number 98231-12VW). Now those gloves ROCK. I am super happy with the performance of the HD gloves and I have been riding all winter using them. I can finally ride year round. I had contacted the seller about getting a refund and they were not at all cooperative and handed me off to their supplier. However the initial supplier of the Firstgear Warm gloves was excellent and tried to do everything in their power to make me happy with the product. I would definitely consider purchasing these gloves from a different seller.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>It's probably the best knife you can get for under $10. Very much worth the price. But remember that your getting a $10 knife.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>I am not afraid to admit that I think Nick Nolte is one of the most overrated actors of his generation, but I think that he was really good in &quot;The Good Thief&quot;, because he was playing someone so close to himself in real life. A burnt out junkie who is closer to the end of his career than the beginning seems to fit him perfectly.This movie is a heist movie to begin with, and director Neil Jordan shoots it with the appropriate glitz and glamour that a film set in Monte Carlo deserves. He nails the atmosphere, giving the movie a dark, jazzy feel, mixing the styles of the classic films noir and the new reinvention of the style. The plot is good, as it is filled with twists and turns, as any good heist flick should. One thing that should be mentioned is the chemistry between all the characters. The cast is completely European, save Nolte, yet they mesh incredibly well together. The relationship between Bob and Roger the police officer is one of the movie's centerpieces, and their mutual respect and odd friendship is completely believable without too much explanation. Also good in this movie is the girl who plays Anna, and I won't even attempt to spell her name, because it could take up to an hour to get it right. She is as throaty as she is innocent, yet there is an obvious dark side to her character, one that often shines brighter than the innocence of a seventeen year old runaway.Aside from the crime side of the movie, &quot;The Good Thief&quot; is about rebirth, in all of the characters. They are all ressurecting themselves from their past lives, trying to make good on the lives that still lay ahead of them. All in all, this is a good movie, and should entertain most people who are into this genre until the exciting end.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I am using this on my new sirius satellite radio, and I got what I was expecting and works great!!!</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>This carafe has been a great addition to my home. I have used it at dinner, and even at my bedside so that I have easy access to fresh cold water all night long.The outside is a stylish red, much less pink than it looks in the picture. The handle is coated in a rubbery grip which makes it easy to hold onto. To pour you simply depress the button on the top and the water flows. The top is easy to screw on and off easily. The inside is solid glass. I love that my water is being stored in glass and not plastic. While this makes the carafe heavy, it is worth it to me.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>Well, exactly like I said in the title...the app is nice and my 3 1/2 year old daughter seems to like using it, but stylus does not work with the otterbox defender. We have an iPad mini with the defender case on it and no matter what angle or how hard we pressed, it would not register a stroke. Return was easy and quick as always with amazon. Ordered the amPen Hybrid Stylus which has been working flawlessly so far!</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>This only has enough supplies for 1 cake. There is no colors for the frosting, and there were no instructions, just what is printed on the box.</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>Faulty switch mechanism.  Sometimes it works on the first press.  Other times it takes multiple (and I do mean multiple) tries to get it to turn on or cycle through the lighting options.  I've kept it because thus far I've always managed to get it to work eventually.  When it works it's very bright and I like the fact that it runs on batteries I can recharge (AAA) but I can't recommend it.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Bought these expecting to get good low bass and I wasn't disappointed. Just need to buy a MDF box to fit them and they'll bump even harder.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>it is a beautiful backpack, i've loved it when i've received it!!!, it has good materials and inside it's a beautiful design too..</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Classic! It is great to watch this series again with my teenager. We are having a blast! Thanks Amazon! Love it.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>I bought this toaster oven because it had pretty good reviews. Most said \"Good basic toaster oven for the price\", and that is certainly true. It toasts, bakes and broils...and that is it! If you just want a basic model toaster oven without all of the extras, and for not a lot of money, buy this one.But, if you aren't a patient person, do not buy this toaster oven because it really seems to take a while to toast. The dial where you have to turn it to the right and then to to the left for your desired setting also takes a while to get used to, but once I had it figured out it makes a perfect piece of toast.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Very easy to install - just insert the HDMI plugs for the sources and the television. I have a Roku box (for streaming music and video) and a Dell computer sharing the TV's HDMI input. The Roku uses the input most of the time, but when i turn on the computer it automatically takes over the input to the TV.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>The lamp this bulb was installed in died a long time ago and  I was ready to recycle it when i came on Amazon and found the helpful reviews. This part is the same part as the Sylvania and indeed is made by the same manufacturer. It came well packed and i was really happy to find it in a protective sealed bag that made it easy to install without touching it.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>This is a good product.  The smell of the product is not desired, however, it works pretty good.  I would buy again.</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>She wore it to her birthday party. She was not being overly active or anything and the fit was slightly big on her. The seams started coming out from the waist down....and there are lots of seams!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This puzzle is beautiful... exactly as described and shown... AND it arrived well within the estimated delivery date.  If I ever want to get another puzzle... I will definitely be checking out what this manufacturer has to offer first before looking anywhere else.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>My kids love them but they really cannot communicate well on them? A little disappointed! But oh well?love and learn</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>It worsa well with the dryer balls in my dryer. Great.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This product is amazing.After a week my dogs stained fur under the eye's are completly white. No more stained fur.Cut off stained fur and everything is fresh as a daisy!!!!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>We have a 22.5' Weber One Touch Gold grill,  for years I have had to put another smaller table out next to the grill to hold all the items for grilling. THIS TABLE is the TOPS!!!  It is well made and fits perfectly on the grill. If you don't have the cover to cover both you will want to get it...  Again GOOD JOB Weber....</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Perfect to replace laptop screen using the same type of screen. Are of good quality and genuine, the mark may not be the same as the screen to replace but operate with equal quality.Perfecta para reemplazar la pantalla de port&aacute;tiles que usan el mismo tipo de pantalla. Son de buena calidad y genuinos, la marca puede que no sea la misma que la pantalla a reemplazar pero funcionan con igual calidad.</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>Owned a different model before and will be searching for that one.On this one there are two size slot openings, and about 3 openings per size. For my cats there are two many holes my one cat was able to empty it without really having to do any work.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I like both kinds of gelatin and it's a plus that it's organic.  I use the collagen daily, and the regular gelatin in &#34;jello&#34; types of recipes.  As I am on a Paleo diet, both come in very handy.</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>Ordered this camera for it very small footprint, its adjustability and mounting method...all perfect for the location it was to be used in.The image was very good....when it came on.That was the problem....appearance of the image was very random and exceedingly slow.Did not reorder because, from the product reviews, getting a working camera seemed to be very hit or miss.The vendor did contact me about it asking if I wanted a refund.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Needed a scoop for out PTA Popcorn machine and this works perfectly :o) Easy to grip and get the popcorn into bags</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This TIE fighter is excellent!!  Just like the one I had when I was 7, only much better!!  The detail is amazing.  No dumb battery compartments for the \"lights and sound\" features--because there aren't any.  The panels pop off for battle damage and have, so far, stayed on when I wanted them to.  The old one I had would blow the panels off after enough playtime and would really bother me after a while because you would just set the thing down and the panels would pop off.  Man, I hated that!!  This one doesn't seem to have that problem yet.  The color of the ship is nice and the price isn't TOO bad where you couldn't buy 2 or 3 to have a nice, little fleet.  I think you do NOT have to buy the X-wing to go with this because the Red Leader X-wing fighter is a much better toy to buy.  The detail is way better and it just looks better.  These classic Star Wars ships are loads of fun and can stand the test of time.  I loved them 30 years ago and my kids love them now.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Keeping in mind I've been a licensed A&P mechanic during my entire working life and I'm fairly smart, I found the assembly easy and well engineered however, some may not. I was able to make certain assumptions and observations because of my background and had no difficulty putting things together. The finish is durable and resists everything I've done to it so far.. Design and placement of drawers, shelves, etc. works good for me. Packaging was well thought out too. Even if you're not mechanically inclined, by taking your time, fitting panels and lining up holes before you do any changing, things go together as advertised...at least mine did.  It is the best assembly required computer desk I've ever had. I've had it almost a month...great so far, Extremely sturdy especially for the money...I am very pleased with this product...</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>This does not work for my mixing bowl.  It requires a straight lip and my bowl is beveled on the edge. I am returning it.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This is a hilarious movie. I highly recommend it to anyone who has an open mind and broad sense of humor. Not appropriate for kids though...</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>Very messy!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>So easy to put into your bun and keeps my hair up all day long without pulling so hard I have a headache by the end of the day. I have long, thick hair but it is very fine and slippery. Works like a charm! One of the best, if not the best, hair products I've ever purchased.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This was a very nice addition to my husband's home office.  It's very comfortable and was easy to put together.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>Loved this as a gift for a friend and bought one for myself. The product is very funny but quite flimsy. It is hard to actually use the tape roller IF you needed to...</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>This toy has small parts. It was great for my 6 year old niece, she really loved it. She plays with it a lot and the paint hasn't chipped of and nothing has broken so it a good product.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>So I'm a graduating nursing student and decided to get one of these for myself. I had one that came in a student nurse pack that literally probably cost about $5. I never knew why everyone fussed over them when I could hear just fine. Then I bought a Littmann and learned!!These stethoscopes have AMAZING quality. I can hear EVERYTHING so clearly. I hardly have to concentrate and listen now because this stethoscope delivers sound amazingly. The color selection is also great!</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>The colors in this palette are so perfect.  The only issue I have with it is that the black eyeshadow gets mixed up w/ the base and I end up having to wipe off a lot of base with a tissue or qtip before I can use it, because it gets mixed up in there.I think the quality of the makeup is quite good.  When I put it on exactly how Lauren does in her youtube video, it lasts all day!I really love it for travel, though.  All I have to take now is foundation, mascara, some loose powder, and this!  No more multiple bottles and compacts of various colors.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Typical otterbox quality. Durable and stylish. This fits very comfortably in men's khakis or cargo shorts. Not made for jeans, the phone is just too big for that..</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>I'm a long time user of colour hair treatments and was very excited to learn about this product.  The challenge was it's not currently available in Australia - but easy to obtain online.I've been using the product for just over a month and can see a world of difference.  It's specifically designed for coloured hair that has been treated for long periods of time.  The difference in just a few days was remarkable in terms of softness and body, not to mention maximum colour retention - something that has been plauging me, especially over the summer months.Recommend to purchase, irrespective of the price.</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>Sad, the stand that makes this case great. Unfortunately it broke the first time I used it.  bummer!  Can this great idea be produced at a fair price?  Oh well back to the other case.....</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>This inexpensive webcam works with older Macs lacking webcams, without the need to install drivers.  Just plug it in, set your preferences, and you immediately get an image.  The camera lens needs to be focused manually, which is a little tricky but does allow the use of a less wide angle lens.  The quality of the image is ok - not as crisp as that of the built-in powerbook cameras. The color accuracy varied considerably between the two computers I tried with it.  Coupled with iGlasses software, I was able to get a fairly acceptable palate on both machines. The built-in microphone seemed to work well.  Overall, it is an acceptable camera at about $30, and fills a void for Mac users, who need a camera a low cost.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Couldn't find the right shade of this produce for my skin tone in the stores. After receiving my True Match blush and have been using it daily, I am really happy with it. Blends perfectly and is just the shade I needed.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Treat bags for a class party, wedding favors, birthday party goody bags -- this is your answer for cute and customizable -- and easy! Just use the pre-made templates to add your custom text and graphics, and print away. But print a test sheet first to make sure everything's spelled correctly. :)</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Not a lot to say about these.  They are staples and they work in the Porter-Cable US58 that I bought with them. They go nicely into wood frames and molding.  I would not hesitate to buy them again.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Good product for the price. I use it on tables at restaurants when my 7 month old is in a highchair. As long as you wet the suction cup and push it down firmly, it holds very well. My son can pull it off when he is determined. But I am always sitting next to him when he is playing. It does a good job of keeping him entertained and distracted at meals so I can have some adult conversation.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I bought these adapter plugs because I was going to Europe from America and I wanted to be able to plug stuff in.  By &#34;stuff,&#34; I mean my laptop, my electric shaver, my iPhone charger, and a 1980s boombox that I travel with at all times just to keep things chill and fresh.  My goal was to be able to plug things in while in Germany--but also while in the Netherlands.  And I was successful.  Are there other adapters out there that can do the same thing?  Probably.  Are they cheaper?  Maybe--but these were under $7.  So I would call this a 5 star purchase.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Had a terrible flea infestation, bought this product and almost overnight the fleas were gone. 5 stars for sure! Don't hesitate to buy!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I spent several decades slinging around large bags of as many as three age-specific formulations at a time, depending on the makeup of my family. I can't do that anymore and I was happy to find the &#34;all life stages&#34; formulation, guess we've come full circle from when I was young and all dogs of whatever age ate the same thing. Anyway, the bottom line was would they eat it. Resounding yes! Rip, the old boy, bolted his down (one of the reasons I like small nuggets) and then was snacking out of the bag until I closed it, at which point he lay down right by the bag. That was a couple of bags ago and they continue to eat it happily. No digestive difficulties that I'm aware of and I do keep up with stuff like that.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>These are very handy to have for use with the bassinet changing table so it is not cold in the middle of the night.</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>Pictures are hit an miss. Has some nice features, but the camera just doesn't take quality pictures on a consistent basis.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>THIS IS GREAT, IT SEALS PERFECTLY AND EVEN FLOATS (BLACKBERRY 9360  (TRY IT BEFORE) ....ITS A GREAT DEAL FOR THE PRICE...</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>Setup was a bit difficult, and now that it's installed, I can't always get it to work properly. When it does, I can get the same results from either my Tivo or my blu ray player.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Needed more storage for camera this was about one third the price at the big box stores I' very pleased.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I've had these for a few weeks. I absolutely  Love them! I've had great results  each time i use them.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I ordered this as a replacement to our occasional pizza nights on the weekends now that I am cutting gluten from my life. I have had gluten free pizza one other time at a pizza joint and thought I couldn't make something as delicious at home. The dough was easier to work with than I expected. It only rises a little bit and instead of cutting it in two I made one large 16&#34; pizza. Just make sure to spray down your pizza pan with pam or similar type spray and get a bowl of warm water to keep your hands wet so the dough is easier to work with. I followed the instructions to a &#34;T&#34; (other than adding seasoning to the crust before the initial cooking to make it more flavorful) and ended up with an amazing gluten free pizza even my picky husband loved! It doesn't taste like the typical greasy pizza hut type pizza but if you enjoy gluten free pizza you will love this! I will be buying more at this price soon, it's way cheaper than order out and much better for you.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>The belt is ok...the attachments are fairly worthless.  The radio holster is a complete and total waste of material, not holding the radio in place at all!  I am a corrections officer and need a very sturdy holster that can withstand heavy usage and lots of jiggling around when it comes to walking up and down top tiers for count, etc.  The cuff case is a bit too rigid, hard to snap shut but the speed loader case works well.  Overall, this gets an &#34;eh&#34; rating from me.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I have had psoriasis of the scalp for over 7 years with no help.  I have tried all lotions, creams, shampoos and sprays.  Most were prescription and cost sometimes $ 300 plus.  I never saw any improvement.  My psoriasis was so bad, I was ashamed to go get my hair cut. I scratched constantly, I even took Humira which did not help.  One washing and I could tell the difference immediately.  I only wash my hair 2-3 times per week and my scalp is great.  I do have one pesky spot, just a little longer with the shampoo and it clears up.</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>The stars are nice quality and although it's a pain to have to individually put putty on each one before sticking them on the ceiling, they stick well and don't fall off. However, the whole point of the ceiling stars is to glow in the dark, and these only glowed for about five minutes before fading out. And this is after an entire day of sunlight in the desert, so they had plenty of light to absorb. Disappointing, because they seemed really nice.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Well worth the money.  The biscuits are strong and hold on the glue as they should.  Well worth the money for the amount you get and I'll order these again.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Timely shipping was great. The lights were simple to install and they look great on my truck. Can't wait to get the head lights too.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Tasty, healthy and it doesn't sit in my stomach like a rock like oatmeal or cream-of-wheat. This is now my breakfast staple!</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>We bought this bubble wrap to protect our things for a move.  It was definitely thick enough and the sheets were large enough for most items.  When we packed our plates and other kitchen items, we placed a sheet between each item.  Nothing broke in the move, which was at least in part due to the quality of the bubble wrap.My only complaint:  The perforations were not always effective, so sometimes we had to search or just rip the wrap where we thought there should be a perforation.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>This scale is nice but it keeps telling me I have the body of a 52 year old.  There is no way to adjust for a body builder trying to get acurate info.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I ordered this flat iron after checking out the current reviews, and I must say I am in love! Because they are titanium I mainly use them for my natural Indian sew ins and not on my natural hair because of the amount of heat they emmit. They are quick to heat up and I love them! I would definitely suggest buying them! In addition to the product being great, the flat irons shipped and arrived extremely quickly!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I give this party decoration a 10!  It reminds me of where I came from and I am still young enough to enjoy it.  I may live in Canada but I do miss England.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>We have a Schnauzer who suffers with anxiety when the groomer comes via \"Goin to the Dogs\", we give her one of these tablets and now the groomer says, \"I can clip her nails without the muzzle on\".............mission accomplished!!  Thank you</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>I ordered this from E.l.f I was so excited when it arrived! soooo many colors. Well I promptly cleaned my face added E.L.F eyelid primer (I love this primer most of all the primers I've tried even, high end primers) and my excitement fizzled drastically. The pigments are awful, even using a wet eyeshadow brush I had to use a lot to get relatively close to what I wanted for color on my lids. If you want decently pigmented large eyeshadow pallets go with NYX or sephora brand pallets. Even for the mere 15$ I paid I wouldn't suggest this item, but I will however regift this to my mother in law hahahaha</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Awesome guy - Awesome Music!  Dwight is one of my husband's favorite country singers, and he was very happy for the download.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>These bars are wonderful! Sort of a \"Good for you\" candy bar. They are a bit pricey but oh so good!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Last summer (08)I purchased a 18x52 pool at CostCo. It came with a totally inadequate pump. (Intex 635 ) I went through at least 20 A type filters and no mater how many times Skimmed, cleaned, shocked and chlorinated there was a slimy film on the floor and sides of the pool. The replacement pump that I ordered is outstanding. all I can say is WOW!! I can actually see the water moving. I have it set on a timer, let it cycle for 2-3 hour and the water is crystal clear. I tested the water today and no bacteria found.  AWESOME pump!!!!!</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>I have extremely curly hair & this stranger works wonders! Most straighteners you'd find at a store like Walmart or Target that range from $30-90 can't straighten my hair without leaving it frizzy & puffy; but this stranger eliminates all that. It leaves my hair starlight & smooth. My fianc&eacute; & run his fingers through it even! This straighter does make cute flips in my hair but it's shape doesn't allow it to make curls like some other straighteners I've had in the past. Overall it does a great job at straightening!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I am a big man, and have trouble getting chairs that hold up.  This one is made stronger than the other big man chairs I have had.  My only question is if the gas shock will hold up over time, but usually that is not a problem with other chairs that do not fasten the same way as this one that has pockets to hold the shock, rather than just a simple hole in the wheel section and seat section.  The chair fits well, and so far is holding up well and appears to be solid.  I was worried about the seat between the armrests, but they are a little adjustable, about two or three inches on each arm.  I am considering ordering another chair just like this one.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>These bottles are great, we also got the large ones as well. They warm easily, are easy to wash and sterilize. Our son has no complaints either. I would recommend buying the silicone sleeves, it makes gripping them more easy and you don't worry about it slipping out of your hand.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>My 7 year old son is OBSESSED with sharks.  He saved up his allowance until he had enough to order this.  When it came we were so impressed with the quality and value.  Our 3 year old fell in love with it, so we got one for him for Christmas.  ;)</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>This dresser looks very nice and sturdy but it took my very capable son a good part of the afternoon to put it together.  I am very pleased with the product though.It also arrived very fast after ordering, which was nice.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>The product came as expected and has been doing the job perfectly.I would buy again when the need arises.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I use this little helper with painting and typing and cooking. It is small enough to not be in the way on a desk or counter top or next to my easel. It will hold 8 1/2 x 11 paper straight up and great with recipe cards etc. LOVE IT! I even took a picture of this to our local Staples store so they would carry them. Was happy to have found more on Amazon.</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>I really LOVED these headphones, but after a couple of months using them for my runs, they up and died.  As others have reported here, they don't seem to deal with sweat very well after time.  If you're not going to exercise in them, then they are nice, otherwise, look elsewhere.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This is just what I needed and it is working just fine on my frig.  This is a very easy way to order and get this when i need it</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Bought because my fingers were somehow too big to play scrabble on my Kindle.These were the perfect size for the game and now I use them for absolutely everything.Multiple Colors in the package was perfection because now everyone has their own personal stylus.Another huge plus is that dirty finger splotches aren't all over my touch screen!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I must say I fell in love the moment it turned on. No dead pixels, awesome colors and sharpness just as expected and no backlight bleeding or anything. And for this price, come on! This can't get any better. If you are still thinking abut buying this, just stop thinking and hit the ORDER button NOW. 30\" S-IPS monitor at this price pretty much beats all the competition including Dell U3014 and the likes. Colors were just about perfect right out of the box.Make sure your computer graphics card has DVI-D output to experience the full capability of this monitor.Don't let the shipping from Korea fool you either. I ordered this monitor Thursday late at night, received it Tuesday morning!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>These headphones are truly amazing. Like lots of other reviews said, you hear instruments and sounds in songs you've never heard before with other Headphones. These go over your entire ear so after long periods of usage, your ears get a little hot. Other than that, these are amazing headphones.Pros:-comfortable-portable-amazing sound quality-very balanced sound-good looking-good price for awesome headphonesCons:-Ears get a little warm after extended use.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I bought this as a gift for my son. He needed a durable time piece for his job and this fits the bill.</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>Just read his reiew below mine...too lasy to write right now.</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>I guess you get what you pay for.With thud one the cover doesn't stay on and tha swing cover barely moves.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I am 26 years old and I have been shaving primarily with Braun since I started shaving. I had Braun (model 6520), which I got for my 18th birthday, and it lasted me almost 8 years. Throughout the 8 years, I changed foil only once. The old model gave me a shave whose closeness was competitive to manual razors.Finally I decided to get this new model. While it's not perfect, it comes very close to it. It gives a closer shave than my older model, provides a softer feel while shaving and does it faster. It still leaves room for improvement, such as providing a better shave in the neck area, but its performance is still much improved over older models.I cannot say that I shaved with many good manual razors, like Mach III or others, the ones I did shave with, didn't actually provide a better shave than this electric model. Of course the big plus with electric is that it  doesn't cut my skin like razors do. Moreover, it's faster and without any mess.It should be noted that face should be dry prior to shaving, or else shave will not be nearly as close. All in all, it's a great product in terms of performance, reliability and comfort.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>We exchanged 3 regular 100 watt light bulbs down the center of our garage with 12 foot ceilings, and what a great difference these bulbs make.  The GE-Reveal are among some of the brightest lights for the price, and the energy savings make them a superior choice for large areas.  Just bought 6 more to finish out the 27x30 garage area we need to brighten up.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>We got these for our grill with a few other replacement parts as a package. However they were a bit too long compared to previous ones so husband had to trim them to fit.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Great fit, and we like the two D clips since it keeps harness on even if the clasp breaks</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>Despite watering well in the fall, spraying with anti-dessicant AND wrapping three layers deep I lost nearly $700 in yews a white pine trees this past winter!!!  Adding insult to my injury, the manufacturer refused to even discuss my situation or at least refund the money spent on this horrible product.  Back to burlap, which worked fine on the same plants for 6 years...wished there was a zero star rating!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I love this blend. Just right. Not too strong but with a rich, bold flavor. Always my first choice from the basket.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Needed to add an extra set of FW ports on a different bus to my Mac Pro.  This works like a champ!  No drivers necessary - works OoB. It also uses a TI 1394 chipset, which is typically the &#34;holy grail&#34; for Mac compatibility & stability.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>this case fits well & we like it.  We have not tried to remove it.  it is pretty. it comes in two pieces & snaps on.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Very nice rich color - slightly reddish, sturdy, and surprisingly comfortable.  Overall a very nice product and easy to put together.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Really really fun game to play. i never get sick of it. after you get the hang of aiming for the can the game gets great.  the only bad thing is that the frisbee is a little heavy and thick compared to others.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Looks so professional and can be used instead of a pre-printed more expensive version. Thanks again and I will keep ordering it</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Very nice and thick. I like how the leather is muted and there is no branding on the back.I may have to return this one since my watch is 19mm and not 20mm.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>The lowest angle is 20 degrees, and it can be adjusted up to the maximum angle of 60 degrees in 10 degree increments.The base and the top portion are both  12 cm (4.7 in) by 8 cm (3.1 in.  They snap together at the top to stay closed when you are not using it.  When closed, the total depth is 4.1 cm (1.6)  (including the lip to hold the device).The gap (lip) that the device fits into is 2.1 cm (.82 inches).  My Nexus fits into it while in the case (Devicewear The Ridge Red Vegan Leather Six Position Case with Flip Stand for Version 1 2012) easily.The back and bottom are metal mesh.  The lip and edges are hard plastic.It does not slide at all when being used, due to the four rubber bump feet.This is an excellent device for smaller tablets and smartphones but I would not call it easily portable. I would not want to throw it in my purse.  The main advantages over a case with an included stand are the ability to use it in portrait mode and the ability to securely adjust the viewing angle.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>These food groups are designed well, durable, look great, and my LO loves them.  She enjoys taking them out of the crates and putting them back in, in addition we like to set up little picnic's with them as well.  The milk carton and chicken drumstick are a little heavy for now, but she will grow into them.  Overall, we are very happy with our purchase.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I used to do partial water change in my 100g at least once every week to get it crystal clear.  With this and Seachem's matrix I now only do water change once every 3 weeks or so.  This is so much worth the price because it saves so much time from doing water changes.  If you want nice clear water get this plus the seachem matrix.  This stuff is re-usable so you can use it forever.  And don't forget to buy the bag to put this stuff in.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I  have a all white Malshi and this stuff is amazing!!! After a good daily dose I realized though once a week worked just fine. He has not had those ugly brown spots on his eyes since I used this. I highly recommend this product.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This item was the perfect thing I was looking for. I was able to get the item fast, as described without any problems!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>It is the better of the coffees that I have tasted - not too strong.  And it gets here on time</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This is great!  It was a gift for my son and he was thrilled with it.  Thanks so very much.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>took a while to get here and only a few of them are ajustable but other than that they were pretty nice</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This is only my 3rd or 4th review for Amazon, submitted because these are a GREAT deal. Some said they were &#34;poor&#34; quality / NOT. Heavy duty, not the elcheapo styles that break on opening. They were in 2 boxes with bubble wrap all around, none are cracked as some said. BOTTOM LINE: IF YOU NEED FULL SIZE CD JEWEL CASES........BUY THESE. I got 100 and will be ordering 200 more.....................</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>I bought this Root Styler to use when I do my keratin hair treatments. More specifically I bought this product to help with my coarse roots and edges smooth in between relaxing. I give this flat iron a 4 star rating because it does get very hot and did work well to tame my edges and roots.The only reason I gave the four star rating is because this product should be redesigned to include teeth for combing as you flat iron as well as thinner, flatter arms so for a closer, optimal root straightening. Other than that this is a great product.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>The tool is very good in term of durability.  However, the accessory the came with the tool is crappy.  The bi-metal blade barely cut two nails and then refuse to work.  The other one (the wider one) even worse, only cut wood and got dull very fast.  You need to buy a set of other accessory almost at the same time when you buy the tool. Never the less, even plus the cost of an accessory kit ($20), the tool ($35) is still not too bad.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>What can I say we all need a good mouse pad. This one looks and works great. It looks 3 D and I enjoy just looking at it.</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>I bought this toy in hopes of helping my cat to be more active, but he has shown zero interest in playing with it. All he does is stick his nose in the middle to smell the catnip. I realize this has something to do with my cat's personality, but I was hoping to find a toy that would engage his interest! If you have a lazy cat, this toy is probably not going to change that. I think I need to get something that moves on its own that he will be interested in chasing.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>ok maybe 21. The headphone opening is big enough in 60% of the cases but I have a bunch of speakers with aux cords and some are a little bit. But still manages to fit ok! Just squishes the case2. More seriously, the charging port could be a little more spacey. It's better than another case I had but it could just be a little bit bigger! It's a problem on occasionOverall, everythings good. The button access on the sides is perfect and this case has a very nice and slim fit with a perfect amount of tack for grip on most surfaces but not too much to pull your pockets inside out when getting your phone.Seems like a pretty solid case! It'll def save your phone but if you expect often and hard falls, maybe get a bulkier and sturdier case. I take really good care of my phone so this is just to rescue from a few drops and nothing crazy. Just waist level drops to the floor.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>As far as quality, this is what I expected from a store-bought costume. The issue with this item is the size. My daughter is 19 months old and very small for her age and this costume was just the right size for her, despite being a Toddler 2-4 size. Perhaps the item I received was missized; however, even for a 1-2 size it was smaller than I hoped. The hat was WAY too small, so I had to make adjustments by cutting it so that it would fit on her head. Other than the sizing issues, the costume is what I was looking for and met my expectations.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>My Pussycat came to us with very-very severe Ring Worm.  After 12 bi-monthly washings, the nasty stuff was killed.  This product smells nice and didn't seem to bother JasPurr when he was being washed.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>It is not bad but be sure your gun has or doesnt have a plug in the handle by the clip my s&w sigma does and i had to trim the grip to fit if you dont have the plug it will work great good product if made for your pistol i learned the hard way.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>i spent 20 or so years of my life trying to find the perfect shampoo for my very samoan thick and coarse hair....this is perfect!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This is a great product. Purchased two of those, one for home and one for work. Satisfied in both cases.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This product works as advertised. I have a new Homelite gas trimmer with a curved shaft and what used to take me nearly a full \"roll\" of line with the old bump and feed method I did with only two 5 inch pieces. I had to \"rig\" the end of it a little to make the retro-fit tight on the the head of the trimmer but other than that, this is the easiest and best product I have ever used for trimming. I highly recommend this product if you have a lot to trim like I do as it will save you a ton of time and even more frustration.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I am normally not a person who writes reviews but after I received the product I felt it is important for me to write for this one.I am a fashion blogger and and take most of my photos through my phones. As most people would know, the camera totally drains the battery and I hate the big and bulky chargers that most other brands have which does not fit my style. When I first saw the LUXA2 brand I was hesitated a little bit because it is not a really well known brand, however, after I received the product, the quality, functionality and style totally surpassed my expectation !!First of all .. IT LOOKS GOOD ON YOU !! you will not look bad when you pull this out in the public ..Secondly, it charges FAST !! sometimes it even feels like faster than wall charger ! ( exaggerated a little bit there but you know what I mean when you are on the road ) ..Third .. some people might see it as a negative star but I actually like the weight of it because I can feel the quality built of the overall product !!Even though there are so many others out there but I think LUXA2 is definitely on to something in this competitive market !! I will need to buy another one soon because it seems like my wife is eyeing on it ... LOL</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Concentrate works just as well as the bona spray that came with my original kit. Very easy to mix and store. A good bit cheaper than pre-duluted alternatives.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I first visited Radio Shack, which not only did not stock this item but said they had never seen one.  The on line purchase was fast, economical, and everything fit/worked perfectly.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This flashlight is amazing. Tough, durable, and holds a charge for quite a while. Shipping was very fast. Just the sound of the stun gun part is scary.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>These are great bibs especially for the price. I liked the first 10 so much that I ordered 10 more. If you expect a bib to last all day with a teething infant then....you must be a first time parent. Enjoy your new baby, but change the bib a few times a day....especially after meals.The best part about these bibs is that liquid stays on the front and doesnt soak through. They also hold up well in the wash.I would not hesitate to say that these are the best bibs available for the money.</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>Cheap, cheap  cheap  and cheap.  It is true, you pay for what you get.  Ended up purchasing a different one.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>still in trial period.  takes about 10 days according to instructions.  works fine, just have to wait for correct period to prove effictiveness.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>This product was great for the price. It looks really fancy. I like it.  Delivery took a while but it was okay for the price.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>I purchased two of these for my average round-bowl home toilets. The back of the seat was narrower than the rim of the toilet, and it was unsightly. They're going back. Other than that, I thought they were well made, if on the small side of regular round toilet seats.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>We bought 2 of these for fun-loving adults. We shot at ourselves and visitors, and had a blast. Easy to use, but not rapid fire. Good for the price.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Excellent sleeping bag. Lightweight for the warmth it's capable of providing. Plenty of room at legs to roll over and sleep on your side. With the extra space in the legs it can get cold spots, however this is remedied by stuffing a jacket or any extra clothing in there. The attached hood provides added warmth and keeps you tucked in all night.</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>I placed each of these batteries into my 2 post cap solar lights. One of the 2 batteries worked and the other lasted for about 2 weeks, then it died. By the time I installed them and let them run for a couple of weeks, it was past the 30 day warranty so I am stuck. (My last batteries lased for 2 years!) I tried to return them, but the  Amazon vendor will not allow me to return the defective product. NOT RECOMMENDED!Over the many years that I have been a happy Amazon customer, I have never had an issue with returns... until now! How can you know if a battery is OK if you only are allowed 2 or 3 weeks? Especially in a solar light, which these batteries are designed for!Poor product and poor return policy (30 days)! I gave this 2 stars because 1 of the batteries is working... so far.UPDATE!!! I have downgraded this review from 2 stars to 1. It is now one month later and the second battery has died.I am now using Ultralast UL14430SL-2P batteries from Radio Shack... They seem to work great so far!</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>ordered 6 boxes....received 4 of the same kind and 2 of a different kind.  all were made the same but the 2 different boxes were lighter in color than the other four....will be using them this coming weekend....I assembled them already now we'll just have to see how the cupcakes sit on them</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Well again FP got me to buy another play-set. And once again the set was really cool. My nephew was all over this one. Big enough to get out but not to big that it take us the whole floor. Pieces are well built and just like the other FP playsets there are missiles that will get lost. 2 figures that are cool looking and fit the set just right. Another good product in this line of toys from FP.Pros: super simple to play with for a 3 yr old or older. Not going to lieCons: Dang missiles will get lost.</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>I have had two of these and both eventually stopped working. The rice cooker is supposed to go from cooking to just warming based on the weight of the rice and water. The water evaporates and the cooker knows to switch to warming. Unfortunately, the first and second time I bought this the sensor was off and the cooker eventually just staid on warm. Cheap garbage!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Bought this to keep my Rightline Gear 100S50 Sport Jr. Car Top Carrier from sliding around on my roof. Worked like a charm.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>My son really loved the movie and at first didn't like the purple minions but once he got this thing he loves them (maybe not a good thing!) - all kidding aside, good quality, my kid is pretty rough with his stuff and it stays together with no problems.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This pan is light weight, cleans easily, and has great heat transfer. The size can accommodate family meals as well as single servings. Wish I had one decades ago!</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>The size said 5.26 X 5.25 inches. The Calendar I received was about 2.5 x 2.5 inches!! About the size of a Post-it note pad. I hate it when the product is misrepresented!!</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>I am having the same problems with my Kuvings juicer that other have reported, alot of foam, pulp and jamming.  I replaced an Omega that I loved thinking I would get a better machine.  It is so bad that I have to strain it before I drink and even then it isn't smooth.  I bought mine from Williams Sonoma, an authorized dealer.  I am not new to juicing and have followed the steps exactly as directed to no avail.  I give this juicer a big thumbs down and wish I would have known the quality of the product before I spent so much money.</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>Poor printing quality. Both drums prints dark on the right and light on the left. You get what you paid for but it works.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This pure boysenberry syrup is just right-not too sweet and not too fruity. Bought two bottles and they were packaged to perfection.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>3M Command products have been a revolutionary solution for vertically hanging items on walls without the need for a hammer and nail. One just needs to be mindful of the item being hung and the wall's characteristics.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>I chose this product specifically because it claims to remove latex paint from surfaces that shouldn't have paint on them.  We moved into Navy base housing in July, and there were little smears of white latex paint on the brown linoleum floors from the painters, plus green and red and blue nail polish from the previous tenants.  Added to the mix are globs of pine sap, which are blackish and sticky.  I managed to remove most of these marks with scrubbing, but there were a few stubborn marks that just would not come off the floor.  I used the Krud Kutter at full strength, and with just a little use of the scrub brush, the marks are gone-even out of the texture of the floor.I haven't used it for any other cleaning tasks, but I am satisfied since it did the job for which I chose it.</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>Very distorted lenses. I wouldn't really recommend them if you need to see through them. I guess that is what you get when you buy a huge package of sunglasses for 7 bucks</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>My eight-year old son loves the taste which makes it easier to get him to remember to take it everyday.  (He never &#34;remembered&#34; to take his Flintstones.  I am guessing that is because he did not like the taste.)  The only issue that I have with this vitamin is that they break easily, therefore, some of them are in pieces.  Otherwise, it is a good vitamin and I will order again.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>... which helps keep down the dreaded 'inward sucking action' while showering.  I like the semi-privacy and light allowing functionality of having the clear top and shaded bottom too.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>No complain at all. My son loves it. He feels more comfortable comparing with another strap together with sax we rent before.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>We love this product for its flavor, health benefits, and its availability. I wish it were available here locally in the Richmond, Virginia area. Makes me want to possibly open a Variety Tea store. Thanks. Will continue to buy.</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>Absolute garbage. Some of the bandages don't stick and others stick so much that your skin literally gets pulled off. I don't know what formula they are using to create the adhesives but this new formula is not better than the ones my pediatrician used back in the late 90s. And the other reviewers were also right about how disordered it is on the inside of the box. Would never purchase again, Amazon please remove this from your catalog and offer us some quality things which you are known for.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This works great for sore muscles and joints! It's very helpful in easing aches and pains from running and cycling.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Good price.... I thought they would be 12 different pirate designs.  It turns out that there are repeat designs.  But they are cute and my daughter likes them.  And for the price.... when the first couple I gave her get moldy - which happens with all bath toys... I'll just take a couple fresh ones out of the drawer and use those instead.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I had issues with my coverstitch skipping stitches. once I received these things worked better. my advice is use the correct needles for your machines!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Needed to replace my Pioneer PLA-25 turntable from 1972 to play my vinyl.This turntable works very well for low price and a lot of plastic. It isfully auto with a dampened dust cover and a metal turntable with rubber mat. Be forewarned that RC wires to A/V are short and you may need to have to add extensions. The preamp cannot be turned off either. It soundsgreat and I should be able to replace the needle for under 10 dollars.Has a speed adjust but have not had to use it. Very happy with it.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>If you only buy one toy for your cat(s) this should be it. Mimics a real bird flying and my senior cats finally have a reason to get off the bed!  Great  toy!!!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>these were a great purchase to get my grandson to take that little bit of fiber he needs.  He loves these and that is a great thing! thank you</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I've been very happy with this cooler over two summers of use as a car-camping refrigerator. It holds ice really well. Opening it infrequently (at meal/snack times) and storing in the shade, it kept everything cool and still had chunks of ice after 4 days in 80+ degree weather. I originally wanted a Yeti but decided the price was too much and found this one after a lot of research. You get a lot of performance for the price with this cooler. I like the stainless parts and the spring that holds the lid open is very useful.</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>The weight of the camera makes for wobbly videos since it moves the helmet around on bumpy trails. You can try to tighten the helmet to your head but you will cut off your circulation before making it work 100%</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Nice cover. Fits well. Great soft material.The stitching where the corners (rear) meet is not done properly.Small hole showing on both sides. Rather than send back I just restitched myself.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I love this stuff.  The waterproof part is where the majic is.  I've used this outside quite a bit now. I even have used it like a protective coating on the ends of my fence boards and it doesnt wash away</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Great price.  From Sony they are 100.  Lasts about a year.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This is the best ever. No more cutting fish oil capsules and getting squirted in the face. Purchased this for our 2 boxers, just hit the pump a couple of times in each bowl and they get their fish oil suppliment with no mess. The container is aluminum which is a plus as there is no plastic contamination.  Will purchase this item again for sure.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>I believe this is the only 256gb flash drive that is a 'Slider' i.e., capless drive.The speed is around what benchmarks promise, around 110 MB/S Sequential Read and 30 MB/S Sequential Write.Sequential Read :  115.810 MB/sSequential Write :  27.733 MB/sRandom Read 512KB :  106.962 MB/sRandom Write 512KB :  18.882 MB/sRandom Read 4KB (QD=1) :  6.482 MB/s [  1582.6 IOPS]Random Write 4KB (QD=1) :  0.637 MB/s [  155.4 IOPS]Random Read 4KB (QD=32) :  7.891 MB/s [  1926.4 IOPS]Random Write 4KB (QD=32) :  1.269 MB/s [  309.8 IOPS]Test : 100 MB [F: 0.0% (0.1/230.5 GB)] (x5)At these speeds, this is no match for the Voyager GS or the Patriot Magnum especially when it comes to writing, but as Flash Drives are, I probably won't be doing extreme writing on it anyway. I also ran h2testw_1.4 on it and found no errors.The pros to this drive are...- Definitely being capless... I've owned many USB's over the years, and I've lost quite a lot of caps so.- Over 50 dollars cheaper than the top performing flash drives(a bit more expensive than Winten I believe, but Winten had horrible reviews so I chose to go with this)So, I think this could be a reasonable solution if you are good at losing caps like me, and  you don't add data to your flash drives very often.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Used this and like it . Did what it said I. The label ,yes would recommend it . I would purchase it again</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>I learned the hard-way that there are two types of Chinese Lanterns: a) high quality with charcoal flame and b) these low quality lanterns with a wax block.  The wax block was extremely hard to light.  One of the blocks melted off the flimsy wire set-up and fell to the ground at my feet.  I have the burn scars as a reminder.  In the future, I will find other ways to carry away my birthday wishes.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>The case is good quality for the money, however it's a ( tight fit) literally, its made more for a soprano ukulele not a concert.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>If you cannot get enough of Jane Austen, this is a wonderful treat!  The PBS series is literally hours and hours of drama and laughter.  In a Jane Austen movie there a lot of detail from the books that is left out,  which is understandable since you can only fit so much in a two  hours.  However, in this collection you have literally days and days of Jane Austen humor, drama and wisdom.  The ins and outs of the Austin characters are so vivid and surprising in each of the shows.  My husband even got caught up in the them! You'll love it!</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>Im a member with LEF, and will be until they change their methods. I tried this product ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. I replaced with their adrenal formula, much better for me</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>i dont know how to take the mag off ik its stupid of me but i cant c a handle</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>I bought these to use for my tub and they came stuck together and the peel and stick did not peel off</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>The sheathe is plastic and feels cheap, but the ax has a nice feel to it.  It needs a little sharpening out of the box.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Good protection. Has pockets for kids books or toys to keep them distracted in the car. Stays securely in place.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Hope its doing its job.</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>I bought these because the standard issue iPod earbuds would start falling out of my ears every two steps while walking...PRO: They stay in. At the gym, walking, etc. Also: Unlike Sony (and other) in-ear buds, the cord lengths for both sides were equal. (Sony's had a short one side so that you can supposedly put the cord behind your head, which is incredibly awkward & does NOT work for everyone).CON: Although the bass was more consistent with the Griffin earbuds (because they were actually staying in my ears), the painful high frequencies (treble) were nearly unbearable. The only way to tame these was to change EQ on the ipod for \"small speakers\" which sort of flattens the sound out and reduces the treble as much as possible. Still so much treble that I need to turn the volume low to not feel the pain. Sometimes I like my music LOUD. The extra treble just *feels* like ear damage.But here's the worst CON -- When one little grey ear cap fell off my headphone inexplicably somewhere between the gym and home, I realized I now have to throw away a perfectly functioning pair of headphones. I was super-careful to make sure that this detachable part was always there, and keep the earbuds in a case when not in use, so I have NO idea how this happened.In short, a decent price for earbuds that won't last you that long unless you never leave the house with them, but then what's the point of the in-ear feature?</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Good pots for keeping various plants in although they're aren't meant to be decorative. Particularly good for staring small trees, shrubs or vines in. A few of the planters in my bundle were ripped down the side but aside from that my army of trees likes them and will live in them for the winter.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Fast delivery. Great chick flick drama. Even I like it too! Much better than the captured copy someone gave us. This is a first rate quality video. Would order from this seller again!</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>I decided to buy this meter after reading reviews of several comparable ones. Seems the others have many reports of defective meters. Add this one to the list. The meter gave crazy readings and would not calibrate, which suggests a bad sensor. I guess no one tests such units before sending them out any more. Note: this unit does not come with calibration or storage solutions.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Incredible live music. Layne Staley's vocals are astounding. Music and lyrics are excellent. In my opinion, this was THE band of the 90's.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I bought three of these and used them this past weekend. These are the best mic holders I've ever used on a stand. Very high quality and the rubber used in the product grips the mic nicely. We use AKG D5 and Shure Beta 87A mics and these clips held both with no problem!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This size last me about a month and the fit is great for my 18 month (running) son. Pampers has really been the only brand that has held up to my busy bee.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>These toys look so fragile - but they aren't.  My son drops them and plays rougher than he should sometimes, and they still hold up.  I think the reason he likes them so much is due to how realistic they are.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>what a difference this product makes.  my 5th wheel hardly moves at all,even on windy days. I would recommend this to family and friends.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>This is a great cake toper and was supper cute. The only thing was that it is heavy and sunk into our cake.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>thank you sooooooo muchit was realy goood,you have high productI well try again buy from youthank yougood luck</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>There is a reason for the plastic spacers.  I am 6'4&#34; and bench 350 or more now days.  These puppies kept me busy just separating them.about three minutes once two got together without the plastic separator.  You can't JUST push one to the side and it will come loose.  It took all my grip to separate two and after the second messup, I did not want to fight them twice.  WOW, is all I can say!!Thanks!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Me being not so smart, smashed my original stone on the floor of my garage.  This is exactly the same and just as great.  I have written a review on the Ultra fine stone, this is a wonderful product. Capable of sharping any steel I have seen(I have 50+ pocket knives) .  Zdp-189 no prob, s30v, even s110v easy.  This is all to a point of course and assuming that you can maintain an even FINAL bevel,(the cutting edge).  Not great for taking off a lot of steel on the harder steels.  I found it difficult to reset the secondary bevel on a CPM-M4 Benchmade, but this is tough stuff. For the final bevel on that same knife though this will put a nasty sharp edge on the finished edge.  Of course this not the final step with this system, and will not get the ultimate result, but as with everything that Syderco makes, it is a wonderful product.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I bought it for the wardrobe. It is a thick material. I think if there is a zipper will be better.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This device is GREAT! Easy to install, easy to follow directions!  The DVD that came with the product didn't work I emailed to the address on the pamphlet, they responded quickly with a link that was quick to install.  I want to THANK YOU for saving our old cassettes! We are enjoying the whole process!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Wow... who would have thought you could get excited over a comb.  Well, I was wrong as this comb really is worth getting excited over.  Yes, It is pricey,  but I am serious it does make for a better hair day.  It is great for combing your hair when it is wet, it takes the tangles out very gently.  Plus, it really does work wonders for your hair when it is dry and I have even experimented using this comb and then trying another comb and my hair turned out much better with this comb.  It is difficult to explain it, however if you try it you will know what I mean.  Anyhow,  I would have no problem giving this comb highest recommendations and am even thinking of buying a spare as I would be devastated if I ever lost it.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Does what it is supposed to do! I'm not a techy person but I had no problems installing the adapter. Once it is set-up you don't have to mess with it which is a huge improvement over the USB dongle U-Verse gave me during their set-up. I have Win 7 Premium Home edition.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>You won't find a better 2 bay 8TB capacity NAS for this price. Have had no issues with mine and it is very easy to install, setup, and access from anywhere. Might not have the fastest transfer speeds out there but works great for its intended purpose. Plus it uses next to no power and the fan will only kick in when it needs to and is controlled by the temperature. This thing is silent except for when the drive spins up when in use. Since part of the outside is aluminum it acts as a giant heatsink and rarely uses the fan.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>So I love the loom, its very easy to use since I am not capable of real knitting or crocheting, and especially since I'm 14 (on my moms account) its not very boring and is easy and entertaining and something to do while watching TV.The looms are moderately sturdy. I used the red one twice and the pegs were fine, no complaints. Then I use the green loom, and all the pegs started coming off when I would hook them over. Very annoying. The pegs will still go back in as I'm knitting, so it didn't ruin my hat but its very annoying to have to keep sticking the pegs back in every two or three rounds. Slightly disappointed that all the looms aren't all the same quality.:(Would recommend just buying the loom set available at Michael's instead.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>The Screen that comes with the kit is made from a very solid material, and is pretty efficient at organizing charts and tables that are often referenced but hard to memorize. I have not yet run the adventure yet, but it looks like it has some interesting situations, and ideas in the module. No complaints on what it did include.My only critique would be the lack of text about being a good GM in this particular system. The main book has a lot of information, and a few general pointers that apply no matter the system.

Keep dropping it but the phone is still fine. If grip is an issue, be careful this case is very smooth.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>I've loved this movie, and I have the DVD version.  But I recently borrowed the BluRay from Netflix and noticed how grainy the picture is. Nothing especially bad, but it should be better than DVD, but it's not.  I have a 1080p, 48-inch Samsung high-def TV, and my other Blu-ray movies have great picture quality, but this blu-ray version of \"Wolf\" is even more grainy than my DVD.  What gives?  And the lack of any \"Special Features\" makes this Blu-ray pointless.  The transfer to Blu-ray was not well done.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This is a great produst and my kids wil have every morning. It fills them up and I love that I order it and it comes right to the house.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>is the best feature on this DVD.  It gives me the flexibility to either complete the DVD in its entirety but in the order that I choose or I can create a 30 minute workout, depending on the time I have available and the areas that I am more interested in targeting.  After the 10 minutes in each segment I at least feel satisfied that the particular area did receive a decent workout.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>The device works very well and is convenient to leave on the desk top ready for a drive to be inserted.  I have numerous only IDE drives and need to be able to get to old backup files. The Seagate drives I have worked perfectly, while the one Maxtor drive didn't work at all. The Maxtor drive has a wider jumper pin bay between the power plug and the data cable. So it would not insert into the device.  Fortunately I mainly have Seagate drives so that is not a big issue.  I don't have any SATA drives lying around to try it on so I have no idea how good that is. It is so convenient being able to insert a drive and go, that I have decided to use it to do my system backups to harddrives instead of to tape.  Some reviews say that have had problems getting the system to recognize the drive after inserting.  This has not been a problem for me.  It behaves much the same way as a thumb drive does.  The only difference I have really notices is in the drive letter selection. Unlike a thumb drive the hard drive apparently gets a higher priority in the drive letter selection.  So when it is inserted any thumb drive you have inserted into the same device will get shuffled downward and its letter will be given to the new harddrive.  The Eject option is also not available, like it is for other external media.  But the drive can still be disconnected in the USB taskbar tool just like any other drive, so there is no risk in losing data with incomplete data writes.I recommend this device. I have Windows 7 running on a bottom-end server class system.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>I love my mug.  I was a little disappointed that it was so small.

The button has to be pushed just right but once it is... click click boom its lit!~ Ikea has nothing on Char-Broil in the \"Uhhh I have to put ALL OF THIS together?\" catagory~ If your not a handy person with a good set of basic tools, you better hope your friend or neighbor is!~ I am a handy person and this was a pretty long build to do by my self(3+ Hours). I don't know if this is really such a con, but for some it may be so i figured I would mention it. One reason it takes so long is because it is a well built grill with a lot of heavy duty hardware and support brackets ~ LOTS OF PARTS TO ASSEMBLE!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Been using this SSD for a few years now as the primary hard drive disk in my Mac Pro tower.

The only fear I have that those little legs in front will evenutally break because they are plastic.

I could hear (click, click) the hard drive head flying all over the disk trying to find data.  I was fortunate to get one last Time Machine backup with the help of placing cold compresses above and below my HD to cool it down (old freeze hard drive recovery trick).  I ordered one day service and got it FedEx on a Saturday! YES! Thanks Amazon!  Received in a padded envelope.  Not a big deal since the SSD is light and more shockproof than regular hard drive.  Additionally, the box allows for reasonable cushion as well.  Good that minimal packaging was used.  I hate when packaging is unnecessarily 10 times bigger than the actual product.  Such waste!  From there it was a reformat and restore from Time Machine.  Everything went well and operated like any other HD.My choice to go to SSD was not very deeply researched.  I knew SSD have been around for a while and I knew of the performance and durability it provides.  I know that the ruggedized laptops at work were running SSD.  If those guys are using them in rough conditions then it should be ok.  Since I believe heat was the reason my original drive went, I decided to just go for SSD because of durability reasons.  I knew it was supposed to be faster but didn't know what to expect.  I wasn't paying attention to load times before so I wasn't very impressed initially.  I then used a friend's laptop with similar specs and saw the difference.  The startup and program load up time are definitely shorter.  It just seems like the programs are on the starting line waiting for your click to sprint to the finish line of loading the program.  I did notice the laptop seems to run cooler.  I do photo editing and I did a test to export a set of pictures.  I didn't measure times but I believe time was cut in half.  So far everything is running well!  Some are worried about degraded performance but I think by that time it would be time to get another SSD anyway.  However, I will be mindful of my SSD usage as I say that... haha!I am glad I spent the extra money to get the SSD.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>I have tried several different habanero sauces and this comes close to being the perfect red habanero sauce.

The box states: \"Read & Write 2 Hard Drives simultaneously.\" It also states: \"Rapid Data Access & Exchange w Single eSATA or USB Cable Connection.\" NOWHERE does it even mention that you should check to see if you have port multiplier capability (which is absolutely necessary to run two drives over one eSATA cable).At this point most systems DON'T have port multipliers. I'm using a relatively new Dell Precision M4400 with the PM45 chipset. It does NOT support port-multiplying.The device works fine, and is only a couple bucks more than the single slot version, but be aware that you likely WON'T be using two drives at once with eSata on this device.Also, the hole in the dust flap that is meant to keep a 2.5\" drive in place is rather annoying, as it fails to prevent dust from collecting inside the device.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I bought this cable to use with my old HP 5P printer after my old desktop conked out. All of my laptops have no parallel port, and this seemed the quickest and cheapest solution for me. I picked this cable bacause of its silver shielding, it looks flexible.Got the cable, plug it in and wait about a minute for Vista to load the driver. Then the printer appeared in the printer list and that was it. Painless. Really worked, despite of a couple of bad reviews that gave me pause.The only bad thing is there is no manual that comes with the cable and nowhere, enven manufactor's website, that I can find if my printer is compatible. So if you have a HP 5P LaserJet and need this cable, go for it. It worked for me. There is a driver cd that was included in the box, but I don't need it. Guess if I run Windows 98 then I will.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Works great with my computer and was cheaper than buying a new charger for my computer from the store !</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Really good!! It's not sweet and artificial tasting..it's almost spicy and mildly sweet? Delicious and I mixed it with ginger rum a few times.  I liked it better icy cold and from the bottle!

They took a painstaking amount of time individually stuffing compartments to ensure it arrives safely.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I always like using glass for leftovers because they don't stain and pick up odors.

There is one small negative though...I started playing RB again after a 15-year layoff, but liability issues  (and common sense) now require eyewear at every gym. I generally don't like this kind of thing, but I'm willing to to accommodate gym rules in order to play such a crazy great game (should be an olympic sport).My first eyewear was given to me by a friend, and I knew after a five-game series that this would be my first RB purchase (before a better racquet, etc.). The eyewear he gave me fogged and was blurry... I couldn't really even play and wanted to just take the damn things off (but couldn't). It was like playing with blinders.So I read up on RB eyewear and decided on these... it's been nine months of heavy-duty play (we play 90-120 minutes for 5-7 games three times a week... there is no dry material on my body at the end of the matches). These have been awesome... crystal clear focus (I normally wear glasses but not for RB), no fog ever (I sweat heavily), no scratches (I wash them before every series and dry them on whatever I have handy). They have adjustable length earpieces and a hearty closed-cell foam band across the entire length of the frame (keeps sweat from running into your eyes).The only negative is that there are cracks in the lens... several small ones that emanate from the nose piece... but they haven't spread and they don't interfere in play at all... I don't see them (they are under 1/8&#34; in length).Bottom line, if I had to buy another pair I would buy these without question. They are great.</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>I was really excited when I received this and thought that I wouldn't have to worry about my daughters head flopping around while I was driving and she was sleeping. I used it when my dad say in the back with baby and he said that it kept shifting and it didn't hold her head up high enough. Her head would still droop down and flop around whenever I hit a bump. So I stopped using it. Back to the old drawing board of trying to look for the perfect neck support!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Does anyone know if this router is good for xbox live?

I called Fellowes customer service and a nice woman called another office to find out about this, saying she had never had this complaint before. She came back with the explanation that yes, they can smell, and that the boxes were probably stored in a humid area before sale. She suggested setting them outside to dry, if this was possible. So, it's been two days and the things still smell, a little less, but enough to get my very allergic husband with his bad nose to complain about the stench. We did not buy these boxes through Amazon but from a major local office supplies place. They happen to be going out of business. We had already taken the boxes apart and frankly, it's a bother to repackage and take them back. But, boy, never again!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Works perfect in my Blade 350 QX.

Good grip, no burns, easy to clean and they are lined so they are very comfortable.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This works as advertised, as long as both of my HDMI components were turned on.  When one of my components turned off (and I have one component that turns itself off automatically if not being used), the switch fails and the screen goes dark.  I sent a question to IOGEAR on this, and the solution was to add the power supply.  When one of the connected HDMI lines loses power, I believe that the voltage drops low enough to turn off the switch.  Adding the external power supply fixed the problem.  I am rating it excellent here because the customer service at IOGEAR was awesome!  In a time when customer service has gone downhill in many electronics areas, these guys were helpful, fast, and excellent!  The switch (with added power supply) is exactly what I needed to switch between my BlueRay player and my cable box.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I love this frame it is very study.

I find that the system where you pack, then push down the bag to reduce its size results in the sides popping out.  Maybe that'll change.  Regardless, I can fit a lot in this bag and it fits fine in the overhear compartments.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>I just purchased this phone to replace a 5 year old Panasonic phone that was outdated.  This new phone is good..except I find the sound/volume not as high as my old Panasonic.  It should definitely allow you to go 2 bars more for talk volume.  The speaker phone volume level is higher than the \"talk\" volume level.  I think I might send it back.  I want to hear the person I am speaking to (they say they hear me fine).  A bit disappointed with the volume level but all else is good.</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>I needed a portable waterier for my dog in a hurry with the hot weather here and did not take the time to read the reviews on this or I never would of bought it. As many have said, it leaks! Even the hang tag on the bottle says Leak-proof and spill-proof. Unless you are able to keep this in an upright position during non use, I suggest you look for something different. This has a rubber tip with 3 slits, and drips when it is in any other position other than upright. It does have to be popped out of the holder/tray and placed in the proper end to use, which can be a hassle. I replaced the rubber tip with a regular water bottle cap and just use it as a portable water bowl. That way I can throw it in the car or backpack, or dog pack without the leakage problem. The only thing handi about this is the price,  as a water bottle with a corn on the cob plastic tray rubber banded to it does the same thing. One review said the \"Gulpy\" by New Angle isn't sold on amazon, it is now. I recommend buying the Gulpy for a leak proof, hassle free container.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>USED THIS WITH MY LEATHER CONDITIONER AND  CLEANER YESTERDAY.  YOU GET TWO SPONGES.

Since I had open heart surgery and I am on all kinds of blood thinners, I am constantly cold and this heater has been a Godsend! It works several different ways and I usually set the temp at a certain degree and let it function by itself. I use it in my den a it is amazing how fast it maintains the heat in that room. My house faces North and as the sun heats up the back of the house (the furnace thermostat is in the Family room in the back of the house, the front rooms get cooler and this solves the problem. I have tried thermal clothes, heated throws, heating blankets, etc., and this beats all of them for keeping me warm and comfortable. I have the one with the oscillation and it helps the room warm up even faster. It's quiet, it has alot of functions and it does the job.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I love the idea of the fast-lock technology, along with the fair price.

The included software makes it super easy to capture your videos and export them to YouTube, QuickTime or iMovie.Unfortunately, there really isn't much in terms of built-in video editing software and given the reason why most people are buying these devices (i.e. to capture their old VHS movies and preserve them in a digital format), it would be nice if there was something along these lines included. Still, as far as the hardware goes, it's pretty simple to use and pretty effective.</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>The Bear Creek mixes are unquestionably 5-star but at more than three times the supermarket price for the same products (NW Suburban Chicago), the prices are tantamount to robbery.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Was of good quality and was perfect for an apartment bath with no towel storage. very pleased with heavy duty materials</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>good for what your going to pay for it,covienent size,adaquate,going to try camera adaptor with it,forget the tripod that comes with it.</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>STATIC. These usb adapter tend to give static out of nowhere whenever your listening to music. I think the issue might be flash related, but I'm not 100% sure. If it wasnt for this issue I would give it four stars, because it functions and gives out decent sound. But frankly this is really ANNOYING. I don't use any other browser but Firefox, and i'm tired of listening to music through my laptop and out of nowhere a huge static sound (similar to the sound of the static you hear when your tv has no tv station on).If you have the money to replace the soundcard in your laptop/desktop then do it, because this cheap,simple fix is not worth it. I have not tried any other usb adapters in this price range but I assume they would have their own fault in them, like maybe hissing/poor build quality etc.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I got a lot of looks with these antlers, people loved them. The only issue is that the plastic things on the antlers clamp to your window so it makes it a little difficult to roll the window up all the way.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>PO5 was a great bit of TV - we loved all the series which were watched faithfully until the final series.This sets it up really well and explains why the Salingers became the excellent characters they did in later episodes.Does anyone know where a UK (or US) customer can purchase the entire final series on DVD?</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This is my first GPS and I really like having it at the ready, I didn't have it very long before I found it to be very helpful. I was looking for a road but the street sign was torn down -- it was Purgatory Road -- so not an unexpected development, I plugged in the GPS looked at just the map feature and, sure enough it was the little road I had just driven past. The GPS has saved me a lot of time getting from one place to the other because I don't have to backtrack. The only quibble is that it is useless in places like the Pine Barrens, it knows how far something is away but cannot even tell you a direction to start finding your way back out -- very easy to lose your way when all those sand roads start looking alike. I guess you would need a more robust one for something that desolate. But it seems to do a good job for your normal driving. When I went online to download the maps I found that you can have many different vehicles from the Garmin Garage, so I had a Christmas cookie one week, a Christmas tree the next and even downloaded a lawn tractor for summer use. What fun! You can download voices too, but they are kind of stingy in this department I would have liked to have some real choices, you can pay for commercial ones like Darth Vader it if matters that much to you.</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>the diapers i received barely hold together. 1.the tape comes apart at the belly 2.once the diaper becomes wet, small gel crystals leak out. i have used pampers swaddlers for over a year and have never had this experience. poor flawed knockoffs!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>The Secret that we all need to know...Order one if you have not seen it yet and learn the secret of every success you want.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Works great and at a fraction of the cost of other processors.  The motor is a tad loud, but is very strong.  Potatoes, carrots and other &#34;hard&#34; foods shred up like they were Jello.  It mixes ingredients well and it has a large enough bowl to handle a good size family's needs.For me the important part was that it cleans up easily.  Other processors made such a mess of clean-up that I hesitated to use the machine.  This one works fine and is a snap to clean.Highly recommend.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Great deal, awesome scale! You really can't go wrong with this scale, it does what it advertises and it does it well.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>I have never used such an obtuse kids toy - especially one that is targeted at 3-4 year olds.After a few Christmas's with 2-5 year olds I have learned the secret of making sure all toys are fully working and assembled with batteries well ahead of time. Otherwise Christmas Day is spent running around trying to figure out crazy toys like this one. I have had a hard time with toys before, but this one definitely ranks near the top.First I put in batteries and turn the switch to on. Nothing happens. I put in newly charged batteries, nothing happens. I put in brand new duracells, nothing happens. This might sounds straightforward, but putting batteries in this thing is nothing of the sort. I wondered why there was two screws on the battery lid instead of the normal one on most toys. Its because the force required to press and keep the lid down is like trying to close a suitcase that has two times too many clothes in it. Absurd!Finally, like some others here, I hooked it up to the computer thinking maybe it needed to 'activate' or some such nonsense. The thing turned right on!!! At least it wasn't broken, I thought. After transferring some mp3s, I read the instruction manual thinking maybe there was a trick.The instruction manual was completely USELESS. It had a small diagram of the unit and told how to plug in the USB cable and that's it.I unplugged from the computer and turned the unit on. Nothing. I thought maybe it takes a while to boot up. So I waited a bit. Nothing. Out of frustration I hit the play button thinking that might be the key, voila!! It turned on!!!That's right, on a toy so simply made you could potentially give it to your 2 year old, they make the prerequisite for playing songs, the holding down of the green button after the switch is turned on. So what looks deceptively like the perfect toddler toy is actually a monster of complexity in disguise with a feature that completely kills the ease of use otherwise. However, even 2 year olds are pretty smart with electronics, I'm sure she'll figure it out.Another tip, but if you press and hold the green button while the unit is on, it will shutdown. That's right, press the Green ON button to shutdown!!!I'm reluctant to give this more than two stars because its extremely unlikely that more than 20% of the people who buy this thing will figure out all of the above. I feel sorry for the folks who think the only way to turn this thing on is to plug it into the computer. However, I'm going to go with three, because once I figured all of this out, I know my 2 year old is going to love it, and it will make my wife happy that she's not putting CDs in her boombox and playing music that way anymore.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Bought this for my fiance who loves old school Twista - really old school Hip Hop in general.

It all started out normal mixing up the bleach then applying it to my hair and I waited my normal amount of time. Then I hopped into the shower to wash it out and as I started to scrub CHUNKS started to fall into the tub, my long beautiful hair being swept down the drain!!! I got out and looked at my head and noticed that my hard literally MELTED off where I had applied that stuff (mostly on my part line) and what was left of the hair o n my head that had been sprayed lost ALL off its elasticity (the hair underneath was still healthy FYI)! I screamed or my fiance who, thank god, is so positive and understanding, and we started cutting off the hairs that were crispy and figuring out how to fix this. I still had hair left on my other side so I could pretty much do a comb over to conceal this catastrophe. But TRUST me it has been 6 months, an extremely short bob hair cut and lots of trims and my hair in places still feels crispy! I can not believe that John Frieda doesn't state a warning on the bottle do not use if you bleach you hair :( I wrote this so noo girl or women has there hair melt off like mine did! TRUST ME IF YOU LOVE YOUR HAIR! Thank you for reading this!</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>I needed these tension adjusters for a 3-speed Nexus conversion on an old steel frame.  While nothing special as far as quality and appearance, they do perform as expected and provide peace of mind that the axle will not shift position while using the coaster brake, a problem that occurred the first time out with the original test setup without the tensioners.  A recommended product.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I really didn't like the fact that the only packaging besides the box was a black bag.  there is a slight  smell  to it but its usually expectable from a product like that.  the color was much paler than the picture  online.other  than  that I tried the product  and  it felt very good.  had a  few  issues  with  the  suction  cup  staying  in  place,  but  it  felt real! not too  big  to  make  it uncomfortable  and  the  heads  just  right!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This was a good movie.  It's about a writer teaching a kid how to write.  And a lot more than that.  It's a real sweet and touching movie.  I think that everyone should check it out.

Keeps it handy for use and easy enough for small hands to take on and off in the back seat when the car is already moving.  I like how the design keeps the erase button protected at the top of the sleeve too.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>The belt buckle is beautiful.  Unfortunately, the prong is so large and rounded that it won't go through the belt holes.  It would have been nice to be able to see the back of the buckle prior to purchase so that I could tell it would not work with my belt.  The company sent it very promptly and it does look like the picture.  I believe it is only for a man's belt though.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Gave 2 away since you only need a little it will last and friends liked it so I gave them a bottle.

I just ordered another bottle!!!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I was looking for inexpensive &#34;stocking stuffers&#34; for my 4 grandchildren, ages 7 and 8. It is true, as one reviewer wrote, that these are musical instruments, not junky toys - the sound is way better than you would expect at this price.  I also like that they are translucent so you can see and explain the 'works'. The kids absolutely love them! Maybe my 7-year-old granddaughter is precocious, but she was picking out 'Jingle Bells' within a few minutes. I also bought one for each parent. Sure beats watching tv!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Based on the theatrical previews, I was expecting more of a crop circle drama. Instead, I received something better. This is a great, thought-provoking movie. It is not for the weak-minded or the viewer just out for a fun flick to watch. Entertainment is great, but sometimes it is nice to have a challenge or two such as Signs. This movie questions the existence and relationship with a 'higher power' without being new-agie or overtly religious-specific. Gibson and the rest of the cast did a wonderful job of mystery, fear, faith, humor, and just plain acting. The director should be proud of doing such a good job with his limited film budget, awesome artistic cinematography, and production of Signs.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>once again great product..but pricey.

But really, there is nothing to improve, it's just a great, powerful coffee grinder. Same good quality as my old one was. I use this new one now for coffee and the old one to break up dog kibbles that are too large for my small dog. Grinding coffee beans is noisy, but the smell of freshly ground coffee is unbeatable as is the taste :)</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I receive the sponge & i love it very muchI read alot of good reviews about this productThanks</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>I bought this yesterday and it came with one day shipping for free im mean the price was amazing for the amount and i dont have to wait 2 day thats a great deal then you get the package thats a whole differt story i coulndt wait till i got home to open that brown box sitting on my pouch it was so light i thought there was nothing in it! I opened it at last my small amazing tool of nothin came just 1 pack of 4 what about the other 11 in it :(, never buying from this loser ever again</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>I really like this wireless mouse.  The micro-size USB receiver  is almost flush with my laptop, and does not protrude past the charging cord.  The optical tracking is much better than any other wireless mouse I've had.  There is one problem with the design: if you have a tendency to drop stuff, you end up scurrying to catch the skin and the mouse. Which I  have done. Alot.  My dog loves it when I drop it. He goes chasing it as if it were a real mouse. They could have put a more substantial lip so the cover doesn't come off so easily. My dog wouldn't be too happy, though.  Other than that, it's a keeper.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>I've been using this TV solely for videogames and it works great. Most videogames look great, though depending on the settings, some games may look a little jagged-edged.

The color was nice, size was perfect but when we first used it and cut food on it the plates showed the cuts on the plate.  I had never seen that before on any other plastic plates I used by other makers.  Im glad it is microwaveable but I do not like all the knife cuts on the plates. For the price of these plates should they really show these cuts on it?</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>The product I received was a brand new, OEM, Genuine BMW part that matched perfectly.The shipping was timely and I couldn't be happier.Those who are saying it isn't genuine BMW because the silver parts are \"raised\" are wrong. If you were to walk up to a BMW parts counter they would hand you the same one I received here. Great product, I'd recommend anyone buy this! Just make sure it fits your model and you're good to go.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I've been using the Oral B electric toothbrushes for years with the little rotating head.This new version came out and my last dental checkup couldn't have gone better.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Used this steam mop for the first time yesterday.  Was very pleased with the results on our large-tiled kitchen floor.  Swept first,  then used the steam mop.  I chose the steamer mop pad, and poured a small amount of the cleaning fluid that came with machine, I filled balance of the solution canister as per instructions (warm -- not hot-- tap water. I did not take notice of the time, but it could not have been more than about 25 minutes to steam/clean our large kitchen/hallway areas.  Solution provided by Hoover smells nice and, along with using the steam, did a great job. I will research where I can purchase the solution for less, or just use something else.  Can also use just vinegar solution (advice given by installer of the stone floor in our kitchen).  With vinegar solution, I would choose to have machine do continuous steam cycle.Where extra steam was needed, I pressed the steam lever (lever was comfortable to use, did not cause pain in my arthritic thumb).I had researched several steam moppers, and had considered the Haan, but I am glad that I saw the Hoover and its reviews.  I am happy with my purchase, and the fact that the pads are priced fairly.It was easy to wash the used pad, and I did it by hand, squeezed well, then line dried in my laundry room.Con:  The 2 canisters were a bit difficult for me to take off the steamer, but I have arthritic hands.  I was able to do it by stepping on mop base, leaning the stick against me, then grasping the canister with both hands.  If you do not issues with your hands, you should not experience difficulty.Overall, I am glad that I made this purchase.  Having owned a Shark which always left my floors not as clean as I wanted, this choice is wins hands-down.  The Shark \"died\" several weeks ago and was put in our town's bulk pick-up.  Our local Home-Depot had a ridiculously low price on this model, and S/H was free, however I chose to have the item shipped to the store where I was able to pick it up.  I did this because we desperately needed to clean our floors after having hurricane Sandy.</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>I tried the dermelect smooth upper lip anti-aging treatment as directed twice a day. Maybe because I am 75 years old I could not detect any improvement. In the contrary, the area above my lips has become very sensitive, I often get red spots. After 4 weeks of faithfully using this product I have decided to give up on it. If Amazon were Macy's I would ask for my money back. It might help younger women, but for me it was a wast of time and assured me again that all these promises that cosmetic manufacturers make are unfounded.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>We bought this for our sons bed because he is still in pull ups and sometimes they leak. This has completely protected the mattress several times. Very simple to wash and dries quickly. We have a shallow mattress, so it is a bit baggy on the sides, but this would be great for a deeper mattress.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Works perfectly for our plants.  Nice, light, and small.  Long spout gets into the spider plants and allows us to apply water to the soil.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>White and black are the worst colors for me to find things. A white phone laying on a table with papers might as well be invisible. My wife got an otter case that is bright green. That works so much better. This case fits well, and I don't know what else I'd want in a case. It haven't dropped it, but it feels sturdy.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>I like that it is not bulky and it is not amazing but its functional. Like the color and works for what it is needed.</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>This product is okay I find that it is a little to large for my application needs and find that they fall off or start to peal rather quickly where as the ones that I paid a little bit more money tend to stay on for months rather then weeks.  I have cut then down to the size of just the screen and then use a skin to go around the outer edges and this seems to hold them down a bit better then just using the protecter themselves.  I do like how they come with a wipe to clean the screen before applying however I would recommend that you clean the screen with alcohol instead!</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>the sauce I heard is great , but the company who is selling it , is the worst company ever, after waiting about a month , they refund my mony back , so ugly behavoir , its not about money its about how you treat your customers and leave a good impression.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>like the looks and composition.  a little pricy tho.  it was listed a few weeks before on amazon for some $10 plus less.  it does the trick however and we are generally happy.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I really like these bars and look forward to eating them.

I relied on internet swatches.  This color is almost identical to Nicki Minaj &#34;Fly&#34;.  If you have that already you don't really need this.  However, if you don't have it already, this is a great shade!  This is slightly lighter than the Nicki one but it really is so similar I don't see anyone needing both!  Oh, well.  Great OPI cream formula.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Inexpensive, but solid. Worked right out of the box.That's everything you need to know, but the review says it needs more words to be acceptable, so I added this sentence.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>This truck is AWESOME, and I very badly want to give it five stars.  Why not? Because this truck has a very vulnerable Achilles Tendon that kills the fun.First, the good:  This truck is a very solid performer, easily able to stand against Traxxas's 4WD Stampede.  This truck is actually more user friendly than the 'pede thanks to it's AVC feature.  Turning this feature up stabilizes the truck, at the cost of slight performance reduction.  To share a personal experience about it, I drive this truck with the AVC turned off for maximum performance.  My sister's boyfriend came and watched me drive it.  He had never driven a hobby grade RC, and was very timid when I handed him the transmitter.  He felt the truck was too much for him, so I turned on the AVC.  With the AVC, he quickly gained confidence and had a blast driving it.Now....that Achilles tendon.......is the four drive shafts from the differentials to the wheels.  Vaterra decided to forego traditional dogbone style shafts, and went with telescoping drive shafts.  Plastic drive shafts.  Brittle plastic drive shafts that break easily, even when puttering around on flat ground.  Horizon Hobby has been wonderful about replacing them for me, but I don't like working on the truck every time or every other time I drive it!  A CVD system for this truck is in the works, and I fervently hope that this rectifies this issue.So..... I will happily recommend this truck IF you don't mind constantly replacing driveshafts while you wait for the CVD replacement system to be released,  as this truck truly is a blast to drive for botn beginners and experienced drivers.  If you don't want to deal with the drive shafts, then I suggest watching and waiting for improvements to be made to the drive train.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>My daughter is 5 months and loves her Sophie.

The Hario happens to sit perfectly on the small four cup carafe that I use. The advantages of the Hario are the porcelain construction helps to keep the coffee hotter longer, and this cone just brews a superior cup of coffee.  I can make two cups as we do not like real strong coffee (I use one level Hario scoop per 12 oz. of water - which seems to be about half the coffee others recommend); therefore, the Size 02 just holds my two scoops of coffee and after a 30 second blooming period, I stir the grounds then use the slow circular pour method with a glass Pyrex measuring cup being careful not to pour above the top of the grounds (water at 198-200 degrees).  As I have to refill the Pyrex once with a second 12 ozs. of water, it helps to keep everything nice and hot (I also cover the top of the cone and Pyrex with plastic lids to preserve heat); stir once again during the last fill. The result is two perfect mugs of coffee every time.  I haven't timed the process, but I think it takes about 5 to 6 minutes from start to finish.  I highly recommend the Hario if you want a superior cup of coffee!</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>This is not the same as Ativa Dandelion tea.

I own 2 Miele's ($700 ea), a Black and Decker cordless hand vac which is the best hand vac on the market I think, and bought the rocket for ease of carrying and touch ups.  I'm surprised by the versatility, ease of use, and also with the pet hair attachment, how well it cleans furniture of pet hair.  It's not overly loud and has a few really nice features, like stopping the brush head if it gets tangled so it doesn't ruin your rug.  Easy to clean, filters just rinse out when dirty, dirt cup easy to dump.  I'm always surprised at how much dirt is in the cup after vacuuming, when I actually thought something was clean.  I don't think it has the suction power of a Miele, but I find I'm using it more and more because it's so nice and light.  Good quality product.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>After years of trying out stockpots and other cooking utensils, which wore out or just plain didn't do the job, I finally decided to buy this one.

One is a tennis player and one is a pretty creepy guy with \"big ideas\" (read: the enemy), they hit it off pretty well, but the second man turns out to get too involved with his ideas and ends up killing the tennis player's wife for him after the tennis player nonchalantly mentions he wouldn't mind having her out of the way.  Now it's a rush to see what the tennis player will do now that he's a suspect and the other man keeps appearing to urge him to kill the stalker's father, via an agreement he didn't make.So it's basically all of Hitchcock's usual fare...  a man on the run, wrongly accused; a man blackmailing him; bumbling cops; a woman who wants to figure it out but doesn't know who to trust initially before fully trusting the protagonist; and old ladies who giggle over discussions of murder.This time I don't buy it, though.  The whole lighter thing comes off as a real gimmick to me (even when the stalker guy drops it in the grate... after the initial suspense, it doesn't matter anyway 'cause he's waiting for dusk.)  I couldn't believe that there isn't some way the protagonist couldn't have gone to the police and proven that he wasn't guilty, if anything because of the two characters they were.  The drunken professor was a useless side-note.  This movie is all of Hitchcock's stuff, but none of his experimentation which is really the stuff I like.In all, this is the most suspensful of his movies, but I can't gather up the energy to care for it.  Once again, I have an issue with the characters.  I'm just so used to Hitchcock telling me the same story over and over again that frankly I'm beginning to feel like he's repeating himself.  The guy had a few recurring themes, sure, but this is starting to fall into merely obsessive pondering of the many different ways to present the same internal fear Hitchcock has of being wrongfully imprisoned.  And with each movie of his I see, instead of said fear making me feel like I'm seeing some auteur at work, I'm beginning to see a guy who needs to relax a little.  I like his much more experimental stuff, where he plays with camera and imagery and narrative and design.  This \"suspense thriller\" stuff with the typical motifs is getting very dull, which is a terrible thing.--PolarisDiB</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>I'm a side sleeper so I like my pillows more firm.

I have a great dane mix so it takes a while to bathe her, but she doesn't mind because she loves how good this brush makes her feel. She leans into the brush as i scrub her in circles and back and forth. Last time i washed her she didn't even need brushed after her bath- she had no loose hair left- the Kong ZoomGroom removed it all in the bath! And, it's ergonomically shaped so I'm able to get a great grip on the brush.This is the second ZoomGroom i have purchased, as my ex-husband took the first one when he moved out.

I was so impressed with it that I immediately went out and bought two of them.  I wound up giving the extra one I purchased to a friend who also loves it. Therefore, when this T-fal came up for review, I wanted to see how it compared to my Cuisinart.After using this machine a couple of times, I would have rated this T-fal 3-1/2 to 4 stars had I not already owned the Cuisinart.  However, because I am use to such an exceptional ice cream maker, I find this one just okay, so that is why it gets a plain three star-rating from me.PROS- It makes one quart of good ice cream (my Cuisinart makes two quarts)- I made both the strawberry ice cream and the lemon sorbet. The ice cream was good. The lemon sorbet came out excellent; although I was surprised the recipe did not call for heating the egg white.  (My Cuisinart recipe uses water instead of egg white.)- I consider the currently listed price of $34.99 reasonable and it's less than half the price of the Cuisinart I purchased.- This machine is quieter than my Cuisinart.CONS- The ice cream recipes are not exceptional.  Although my strawberry ice cream came out good, it was not as creamy or sweet as the recipe that came with my Cuisinart and it tasted icy or more like sorbet. The recipes that came with my Cuisinart are outstanding and a bit more flavorful and probably more calories too.  For instance, the T-fal strawberry ice cream recipe calls for strawberries, powdered sugar, lemon, and heavy cream.  My Cuisinart recipe also includes adding whole milk and vanilla extract and it uses regular sugar instead of powdered and calls for about  more sugar than the T-fal recipe. I did not mark it down for this because this has nothing to do with the ice cream maker itself and recipe books can always be purchased.- The chute on the cover is a little too small so it is not as easy to pour in the ingredients without messing up the top.- Assembling and disassembling the unit is \"sticky\" and tricky.  I had trouble removing the freezer bowl from the base because there is no grip when pulling straight up.  Even lining up the top and locking that in place was cumbersome; although after several tries I have that down well.  The paddle also requires a good push to get it into the motor but now seats easily.- The instructions for cleaning are not adequate.  There are actually 6 parts to this ice cream maker (as opposed to the 5 parts shown in the instructions).  My Cuisinart only has 4 parts.  In order to clean everything but the motor, I had to dissemble all parts. Getting the bowl out of the base is the most difficult.  However, I had to dissemble the lid after making ice cream because the ice cream got stuck in the crevices of the top.  I did not have to do this after the sorbet.  The lid coms apart easily as long as I flexed it when I pulled it away from the nubs holding it in place.- In my opinion, the bowl takes up an odd amount of space in my freezer compared to my Cuisinart. My Cuisinart 2-QT bowl is totally cylindrical and measures 7-3/4 inches wide by 6-3/4 inches tall.  This T-fal 1-QT bowl is flared at the top and measures 5-1/2 inches wide at the very bottom to about 9-1/2 wide at the top due to the handles.  It also measures 6-1/2 inches tall.No matter what machine one chooses, making ice cream is messy and requires prior preparation because of the cooking instructions and the fact that time is needed in the freezer for the ice cream to harden. Also making ice cream usually costs more than buying the pre-made product. The joy I get from making my own home-made product, however, far outweighs these caveats.In summary, although I cannot attest to the longevity of this machine, I think this is a decent ice cream maker for making small quantities of ice cream.  Had I not owned a Cuisinart, I would have been more pleased with this machine.  However, the cumbersome assembly and disassembly is the main reason it is a three star machine to me.PS For those who are interested, I pasted a link to my Cuisinart review in the comments section of this evaluation.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This is a darling salt and pepper shaker set that we bought to go with our Halloween tablecloth.

All one needs do is listen to \"Jesus of Suburbia\" on more than one occasion (and preferably in a variety of moods and / or under the influence of this, that or the other thing) to acknowledge the aforementioned assertion as a mere statement of fact..and yeah, when speaking strictly of Billie Joe and Co., here one needs not refrain from employing the adjective \"mature\" both liberally and of necessity.

I used to be a tent guy for all seasons, but have since realized the joys of ultralight hiking (under 20 lb loaded pack for a long weekend; food and water included). BTW: Hammocks are very comfy once you get the diagonal sleeping thing down.I recently bought another from Amazon for my wife. This one did not come with tree straps, not a big deal when Amazon was nearly giving them away. They set up in less than a minute and take down in less than 30 seconds. I've tried others. In fact my son has an ENO (a bit heavier and more$$) and a friend of mine has a Clark (a lot heavier and big$$$). Though I don't think there's anything quite like a Clark, and the ENO is nice as well, the Grand Trunk is a great hammock and has served it's purpose on many hikes and is still going strong.</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>this product is a good privacy screen if it was meant for privacy 4-5 ft away.

When travelling, I have placed it atop the stack of phonebooks one finds in their hotel room. If not then be prepared to lean in a little. For the price I'd say it does its job and the manufacture chose quality materials putting this together. Aside from the inclusion of a protective case with this purchase, the next thing I'd improve would be the height it unfolds out to. Otherwise, if you don't mind angling the mirror up it works fine as is.This also works well with their 10x tabletop mirror.

Even the late Fred 'Rerun' Berry, was not seen in every episode, thus Danielle 'Dee' Spencer and Haywood 'DeWayne' Nelson were featured more prominently, and guest stars such as the Doobie Brothers and Greg Morris (Mission Impossible / Vegas) appeared.

I also took some close up photos of my families decending and they were playful fun photos but up close with all their dive gear on.  I duplicated them and mailed them off.  If you don't have a the money to invest in a professional underwater camera and only vacation dive, I highly recommend this camera for the job.  If you are deep and the camera won't wind, just accend a little and the underwater pressure will lessen then take your photos.

Imagine the suction of your Shop-Vac pulling through the tip the size of a pencil! That gives you an idea of the cleaning ability you can get with this add on kit. We had broken glass from a shattered windshield of our van - in the heater ducts, the recessed speaker enclosures, EVERYWHERE! We used  the micro kit in conjunction with our regular size Shop Vac and were able to get  all of the glass from these hard to reach places. You can regulate the suction by how close or far away you hold it from the item to be cleaned. Extraordinarily functional for all kinds of needs.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>i was impressed with all the plants ordered. they came healthy well wrapped and when i getmy house a bit more organized i may purchase more from this company.i just wish they had a bit more careinstructions, but other than that very pleased</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I loved the way it was shipped to me right away. Was able to get it before christmas. it was such an easy purchase, i didnt have to set foot in a store.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Love it!  Pretty just like I expected!Wish I could get it in a Queen size!</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Very smooth operation and fairly easy to assemble.  Just wish it had a lighted display and a personal tracking program.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>We bought this after seeing the display in a BB store. Our son enjoyed using it during that time.  It has been fun to use at a couple of parties but it is still nerve racking when other people use it.  Definitely a good add-on for your panasonic tv.  If you have a Xt60 plasma it is a cool toy to have.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>My son doesn't want me to feed him anymore, so food is all over the place now.  I love these bibs because they're not only waterproof which makes for easy cleaning, but they have pockets to catch dropped food. Depending on the mess that is made, I reuse a bib several times before washing it in the washing machine.  It washes well.  I put it on low heat in the dryer or just let it air dry.</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>I got these to take on the days I just can't face swallowing a big multivitamin. Unfortunately, these taste chalky, and they become discolored and strange textured long before the expiration date. I won't be buying them again.</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>doesn't cut as close as the oster brand will never buy andis brand again ceramic isn't as sharp as metal from my experience</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>I've had this hose for two years and have not had any problems with it kinking but then it's been on a reel the whole time so hasn't had too much opportunity to kink. However, it's recently sprung a leak at the brass coupling near where it attaches to the hose reel. There appears to be a crack on the joint so now when the hose is turned on, a significant amount of water spurts out of this crack which is annoying to say the least! There doesn't seem to be any way to replace this broken piece so I guess I'm going to have to buy another hose.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I used this as a gaming mouse, and for $15, it is really unbeatable!  I don't even need a mouse pad, the sensitivity is so good!  It's sleek and looks cool, has some badass lights.  The scroll wheel is sensitive and doesn't feel like a $15 mouse.  The two buttons on the side fit perfectly and are quick and responsive.  As a whole, it's the best mouse I've ever used, and I don't think I'll ever buy another one!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Product received sooner than expected and as advertisied.  Heavy duty construction and good instructions.  While mounting hardware was good I did upgrade it to longer, heavier screws/bolts, since the bike is hoisted and stored above a car.</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>Terrible product, I'm pretty sure it is organic, but contains about 30% of soil itself, everything else is wood chip and other very dry organic matter. I grow my own heirloom tomatoes, so I decided to give it a try this year and start my tomatoes in a small greenhouse, the plants burn to yellow in no time. Big disappointment, now I have to transplant the plants to normal soil to save them.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Well, what can I say other then it took 5 minutes to put together (so simple) and it looks great. I've been using for a couple of weeks, very Durable and looks nice and the obvious, keeps things much cleaner outdoors. Though, in certain situations based on decor, tastes, would look good indoors.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>It's simply amazing.

Works great for surfing the web and whatnot while relaxing on the couch.The keyboard layout is a little bit non standard and if you have big hands like me a little cramped.  So I took a star off for that.  But the built in Track Pad is a must for easy couch surfing.  I just wish they had this in a slightly larger package.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Great show and it's spin-offs and movies.

But hey, that's prbly quite an assumption. Maybe my polish was getting old? Not sure, but nonetheless, the color of Bikini So Teeny is absolutely beautiful!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I have used a Paul Mitchell straight iron in the past but didn't like the new model. I have purchased two other irons, only to be unsatisfied.  I had never used HSI before but thought the price was right. I received it very quickly, even over a holiday weeken, and love how smoothly it glides over my hair. It heats evenly and doesn't give my hair the crimp marks other irons can tend to leave.</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>DOA. Wont charge..  Good thing I ordered with my prime account. Luck of the draw perhaps?Battery looks factory and in good condition.  May have been slightly used, very minimal scratches on battery contacts.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>Ordered these for our German Shepherd.  The price was really good for the number you get.  When she gets chewing them however, lots of sharp bone shards break off.  This wouldn't bother me except that she immediately swallows them.  We've bought other brands that didn't seem to break as much.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>I got the same product for $6 from Home Depot. This one definitely attracts ants as opposed to other brands that just don't have any effect on them. It helped me figure out where is the colony because of ant trail. Before putting it out I had no idea what is the source. Luckily ants were coming from under the baseboard in bathroom behind toilet bowl. I put these just in front of the ant hole. Ant stormed on them and didn't bother coming any further so no ant was seen in rest of the house as long as we have the baits in front of the colony. It seems to work because ants went crazy on it for 2 days and then disappeared, after 2 days new batch of ants went crazy on them. I kept replacing with new bait stations. It has been going on for 3 weeks and 5/6 generations of ants have been fed on my expense. I am not sure if this killing them or I am having ant farm. I have read mostly positive reviews of this product and am so disappointed that it is not working for us. Ants for sure disappears for 2 days before new one comes. Also, they move very slowly just before disappearing implying they had been effected by poison. So this product is worth trying.Finally, when last batch was wreaking havoc on the bait I generously sprayed windex (glass cleaner) on them and on the nest. It killed them on contact and I made sure that a lot of windex gets seeped into the nest. It has been 4 days since, no more ants so far. I think I will stick with windex until I get another solution. Any advice?Am I attracting ants from different colonies? But source of trail is always the same place, the hole behind bowl. Can there be multiple colonies in the walls or ground but ants are showing up from same hole because I put bait in front of it? To counter that problem I am going to put cinnamon sticks in front of that hole as it has worked for another hole in the house. No ants are seen coming out of bedroom hole that is stucked with cinnamon sticks for 2 months now. On unrelated note, I have killed 5 ants that looked like queens a couple of weeks ago. I was so happy to catch them believing that killing queen is the end of colony but no success on that one.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>We purchased the Razor MX500 for our 4 year old son.  He wanted a dirt bike and we didn't want to pay for the gas powered bike until we made sure he could ride and that this was something he would like for longer then a month.  He loved it and has ridden it for over a year and it's still going.  This was a great purchase and less expensive then purchasing it direct from the local retail toy store.  My husband and oldest son who is 16 were even able to ride it.  Fantastic purchase.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>Great picture online but was somewhat disappointed when this comforter arrived.  The upper part of the comforter is a SOLID light color (it actually looks like a dirty cream) which emphasizes the unattractive color.  The weight is great for a summer comforter but the fabric is very shiny and just not what I find to be appealing.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Love it, got this for the holidays and the football playoffs as well as movies for the family room.  Works like a champ!  Good overall sound that fills the whole room.  If your looking for a good quality sound bar than look no further, it is a Bose!!</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Battery works good and fits my laptop well and has a 4 hour charge on my hp mini 110. The battery does lift the laptop back about 1/2 in off of whatever surface it is sitting on so the keyboard has a permanent incline, which i think is kinda nice.. but that depends on the person.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>If you are looking for a light, easy to use, incredible suction power, easily emptied canister, portable stair and pet cleaner, look no further.  The fact that it has a 5 year warranty is the icing on the cake.  LOVE this vacuum cleaner and I'm a dude, so that tells you something.  We have 2 dogs, one who sheds like a monster, and the amount of hair this cleaner picked up directly after using our old vacuum was insane.  Not to mention we filled a whole canister just from cleaning the couch with the detachable tool.  When I saw the amount of dust leaving most vacuums in the infomercial, I knew that was were our dust problem was coming from.  Now we only dust once a week and the house even smells better.  For a third of the cost of a Dyson, this was a no brainer.  We have had it for a month so as longs as it continues doing whats it's doing, best $250 I've ever spent on a vacuum when we go through one a year.</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>While it is nice they are healthier, they have a very odd texture when made as indicated and the taste is not that great. I understand it is hard to make a healthy product taste great but these miss the mark by a long shot. Definitely would not recommend them. I do not want to force myself to eat something I do not enjoy just to make it healthier. I would rather not eat them at all then have to put up with these.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>It's not strong enough to hold purses. I'ts way too light and fragile. Doesnt hold much weight, wasn't much satisfied when it came off the wall after hanging a few purses.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>The ad says it holds 20 oz.  It really doesn't, because you can only fill 16 or 17 oz into it.  There just isn't any way to fill it to 20 oz. I really don't like products with false advertisements.  I do like that it is easy to clean and fill, which is better than the Perky Pets feeder.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>These are really good measuring cups.  I've been using mine for several years.  The markings are still intact, but somewhat scratched.  My only complaint is that after years of use, the bottoms of all three cups have cracked and now leak.  Not sure how this happened as we are always very careful with them.UPDATE: I emailed OXO and they replaced all three cups free of charge when I told them they were cracked.  Great customer service!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I didnt use the screws that came with it i used the command hooks which work just as well as screws Ill load a photo of mine to show how awesome it is, i might buy another one because i still have some plush animals on my bed though i do have a lot more room on my bed now lol this hammock is large and holds many animals</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>These are cute. We bought them for my 6 yr old daughter, but I think she's still a little young to use it correctly.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Let me start by saying this thing is VERY HEAVY! This is one adjustable hitch that you can really use. One tip, the hitch is solid steel, there is no hollow tube so certail anti-rattle or locking hitch pins won't work. Another thing to think about is how far down this will hang from your truck. If at it's lowest point it's a 6&#34; drop then you also have to consider  the other ball that's hanging down so now your looking at around 9&#34; hanging down. I never thought that a 2wd 3/4 truck would scrap the hitch on an approach.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>This is definitely a sharp one, and if you make it through the first twenty minutes, you will absolutely be pulled in through the last minute. It's intelligent, and it's a thriller -- the kind of thriller that is not blood and guts and unnecessary violence, but rather is intelligent and realistically disturbing.Sarah is a successful, professional, sexy woman on her way to celebrate her tenth anniversary in a cabin by a lake. On the way out of town, however, two street teens let themselves into her car, hold her at gunpoint, and demand that she drives them to wherever she's going. Thus begins a \"vacation\" that will change everything, forever.With an underlying message of \"there are two kinds of people in the world, those who need to be rescued, and those who want to rescue,\" the plot takes many turns that are intelligently connected and have surprising secrets (who knew it would turn into a lesbian story?) that make all three characters both heroes and victims.Show Me is a story about a seemingly happy and perfect yuppy colliding paths with two distraught teenagers left on their own and yearning to get out. What results is a gripping, thrilling, mind game of a movie.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>i'm 23 light skin with black heads and dark spots its been 3weeks useing this soap and i'm loving it my face looks so good all the bad on my face is disappearing you gotta give this a try you will fall in love.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Hearing aids domes arrived before the expected arrival date which was a good thing.

Dyson tends to get top marks in most reviews, but they are a bit out of my price range.  I came across the Shark Navigator and found a good deal on Amazon.  My mom ordered it for me as an early Xmas present.  After one use, it looks like it's the first time my floor has been vacuumed since I moved into my apt.  I was stunned at how much dust was in the canister after a single use.  This thing has serious suction power and I'm extremely satisfied.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Nice set and quick shipping. But it does not have a small enough tool to open the Nintendo WII system. I should have researched what was needed before buying this set. I could see the set being handy though for other electronics, just not for what I needed it for at this time.</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>Not exactly right.  Even in the straightest position this still has my screen tilting about a 15 degree angle, which is not what I was looking for.  After emailing the company to see if they had any suggestions on how to fix the problem, I did not receive any response.  For that reason alone I will give this one star.  There are plenty of different brands of TV Wall mounts so I don't see any reason to deal with bad customer service.  I previously purchased a Peerless TV Wall mount for my 40\" LCD and it has been perfect.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>My holder arrived in an unusable condition.  The plastic is so cheaply molded and poorly finished that a large scab of excess material prevented it from even being opened.  I had to disassemble the whole thing (tough to do without cracking the plastic), take a Dremel tool to it and grind down about an eighth of an inch of material from the back of the lid to make it where the lid could even open.  The lock mechanism is a little tricky at first, and not well-explained or obvious in operation... you have to pull the knob out toward you before turning, and then it locks in the open position.  To close again you have to shut the lid firmly and give it a slight twist in the \"open\" direction before it will unhitch and lock.Overall though, once I made those modifications and got used to the lock operation, I have to say it serves the purpose... it stores the blades and disks safely and securely.  I would have expected better craftsmanship of a Cuisinart product, though... this was definitely not a polished product.Update:  My mother got a similar Cuisinart food processor and wanted this blade and disc holder, so I got it for her last Christmas, figuring that I could do the same tweaking to it so that it would work fine for her out of the box.  When I got it and checked it out, either they've improved their manufacturing process and quality control, or I just had a really bad one for myself, since the one I got for mom worked fine.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Fits his camelBak bottle perfectly, I am so glad I could just replace the parts instead of having to buy a entire new bottle.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Nothing much to it.

I read other reviews that said they ran a little big. This size works for him. He wears them over training pants, but I think they'd fit over a prefold or fitted cloth diaper as well. They do not make noise and seem to be comfy. He does not complain about them at all. He hasn't wet in one yet. He's pretty much potty trained, but wears these when we leave the house...just in case.I previously used the gerber training pants on my older kids and these are much nicer...thinner and more flexible elastic.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>I don't really have any problem with them besides the fact they are smaller than I thought.This has happened to me a few times with different things I've bought...

Within a week his alligator had all it's squeakers punctured. After nine days, he insured the squeakers were ripped out one by one. Finally, eleven days past receiving the beloved alligator, we had to shelve it and order another. This toy is awesome, though one with a short lifespan. Finger's crossed the second one lasts longer.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>It really works.  Due to the quick disconnect attachments, I can use it on my SUV or motorcycle without reinstalling the cables.  The unit will automatically test the battery to ensure you can reach full capacity.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>I agree with the first reviewer - the first mouse steamed up the inside of the trap before I found it in the morning. Since the reason I go through the trouble of humane traps is to NOT kill them, this is a problem. I drilled holes in the tops for ventilation, but the holes continue to get larger, as those strong little teeth spend the night chipping away at them. Think I'm going to try one of the metal traps. One thing I discovered last night: the Wildlife Mix (corn, sunflower seeds, peanuts) that I put out near the bird feeder is a mouse magnet! After a couple weeks of trying crackers, cheese, peanut butter, etc., with few results, I put out five of these traps last night with Wildlife Mix in them, and this morning I had four mice. Bottom line: these traps are easy to bait and do a good job of catching and holding the mice (only one Mighty Mouse was able to topple its trap on to its side and escape), but some ventilation would have been a good idea.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Super small but still able to read clearly and I like how they are sorted by colors. I'm going to put these in my kids journals in huge front so they have it all year.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I use it for everything in the shower. Face, body, hair. It's got a fresh feeling as its peppermint and as such, kind of mentholated. Love it!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I am a bass head and not an audiophile and this small set up really delivers my bass. I don't know much about sound and what not but these speakers sound great in my opinion. They deliver great bass and that can be adjusted to your liking. I especially love watching movies with them.I got these speakers when they were 125 and I don't regret buying them. I would wholeheartedly recommend these speakers to people looking for a small speaker setup with great sound.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>I guess since it is genuine leather I expected a little weight to it but wow it's heavy by itself! As a person always trying to stay in shape and making the best out of every situation I look at it as a way to gain a little muscle while carrying it around. However, I will need to buy a light weight computer case for traveling as this is not the briefcase to take on a trip if you have any desire to be comfortable. Overall though, beautiful and durable.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I just needed a little something to have a water bottle in during my daily walks.  I think it is perfect.  It is easy to put on and snap off, which is important, because if your folded up the stroller with it attached, it could get bent or broken off.  Overall I was worried about the ease of putting it on and taking it off, but my worries were unwarranted.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>This is a great toy.  The velcro on the cookies makes it really feel like you are cutting the cookies, and then you can put them all on the tray and put on the frosting.  My 2 year old son really enjoys playing with it.  Great Toy!</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>They did not look like the glasses in the picture:( I would never wear them in public.

Totally bogus product.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>I was very thrilled to find this Contigo bottle as I had the regular one and loved it, however , though the pocket handy, it is heavy to lift to drink and the attached pocket tends to slide up.  I will order the regular one and use this just for special needs with the pocket.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>I'm only giving this product a 4 star rating b/c the hat is so terrible.  It really is ugly and fits funny, plus it doesn't even look like a conductor hat.  Other than that, I loved the actual &#34;body&#34; of the costume.  I had a hard time finding a Thomas costume for my 18 month (25 lbs) old since the toddler aged one said &#34;one-size&#34; fits all...but then I found this costume.  This is perfect for an 18month old and even a bit older...probably til 2 yrs.  The picture shows a baby wearing it that is clearly younger than even 12 months...so don't be deceived.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Makes black paint look amazing! Easy to use, clear instructions, and it oddly enough smells very good. Hides small scratches and chips well, larger chips not so much. Have a few sets of gloves and plenty of microfiber towels handy when using this.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Have had this mug for well over two years, and it has really held up.  Although, the Migo mug isn't the best for insulating, it does insulate (not too important for my need).  The lid does leak if it isn't tightened properly.I keep the mug on a table near my bed (I'm bedridden) usually filled with water for taking medicines.  The non-skid bottom of this mug (the reason why I chose it!) is extremely helpful for someone, like me, who has uncoordinated movements and an imbalanced (muscular-wise) body.  I am in need of this particular item because my physical handicap dictates it.My physical issues are due to a neuro-muscular disease/disorder (supposedly supported by MDA) that is both debilitating and degenerative and involves the progressive loss of coordination and muscle strength leading to motor incapacitation and the inevitable confinement to a wheelchair.  In my experience, MDA is a JOKE!  I have learned that MDA attempts to make everyone believe that they are out to help people like me, but instead, exploit us for their own selfish monetary gain!  During my lifetime of 45 years, realistically, MDA hasn't done anything for my disease/disorder -- not even a simple treatment!</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>I purchased this item and received it very quickly as always. I used the clippers right away and found that they cut very nicely and fit very well on my 105 pound German Shepherds nails. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because the rubber grips are simply slid on the handles, They are not adhered in place which I found to be a slight problem. I will somehow adhere them in place. Otherwise, this product would be 5 stars.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I'm glad I tried taking this.

The teacher really appreciated it (and I appreciated that it was a lot less expensive than buying smaller packs of pencils).</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I scanned over 2400 Ektochrome slides, over 3000 photos and over 1000 35mm film strips using this scanner and was pleased with the results. Being able to scan 12 35mm slides and four to six photos at a time is a tremendous time saver.If you expect to load the film in the scanner and push one button and have the scanner/software do the rest, you will be disappointed. If you are willing to do a minimal amount of work you can get excellent results in a reasonable amount of time.As of February 2012 all the delivered software will install on Windows 7. I installed all the software on a Windows 7 64 Bit Professional system and had no problems. I also has no problems with crashes or other software malfunctions while using the software.As mentioned in other reviews the provided documentation is extremely minimal and using the scanner/software requires extension experimentation and trial and order. Two sites providing detailed technical reviews of the scanner and software which I found useful are:[...]I used the Epson software for all my scanning. I tried the provided Silverfast SW and a trial version of VueScan but found that the Epson software best took advantage of the features of the V700 scanner. With the other software I could never scan 12 slides of multiple photos in one scan. The Silverfast web site indicates that they will provide a free upgrade to their latest version, but they haven't updated that version for the V700 so I did not bother with it.I scanned my slides and 35 mm film strips at 4800 DPI to JPEG files with the Epson software using the HOME mode with color restoration enabled. As far as I can determine the Home Mode is the only mode that allows you to scan 12 slides or multiple film strips at one time. The Professional mode seems to only allow you to scan one slide at a time. It took 10 to 15 minutes to scan 12 slides at 4800 DPI. The automatic marqueeing or outlining seemed to work pretty well in this mode. I used the Prescan option to check the images before final scanning.The slide numbering scheme in the slide holder is9  5  1  White dots10  6  211  7  312  8  4For scanning slides, negatives or film strips the document mat should be removed.I scanned my photographs with the Epson software using the Professional mode. I scanned the photos at 1200 DPI to JPEG files with color restoration enabled. The Professional Mode allows you to scan multiple photos in one scan. I was able to scan four to six photos in one scan using this mode depending on the size of the photos. After the photos are Pre-Scanned it is necessary to marquee or outline them manually before final scanning. However, the Epson software remembers the marquees or outlines from  scan to scan so if you place the photos in the same position from scan to scan you can minimize the manual marqueeing usually having to adjust only one of them. It takes about three to four minutes to scan six photos at 1200 DPI.The Home mode allows you to scan multiple photos without manual outlining or marqueeing but does not allow photoshop like correction to be made during the scan.The photo numbering scheme for six photos is;TOP2  14  36  5For scanning photographs or documents the document mat should be installed.I did a Web search to determine what DPI to use for scanning. This search seemed to indicate that for archiving slides or negatives 4000 DPI was sufficient and for photos 600 DPI was sufficient. The V700 seems to only scan at discrete DPI's so using anything other than what the Epson software provides(Silverfast or VueScan) results in software interpolation being done.If you want to verify what DPI your scanned picture are you can use Adobe Photoshop to do this:Open the digital image in PhotoshopSelect Image->Image SizeResolution will be shown in pixels per inch.Problems I had using the scanner and software:1. As another reviewer mentioned the software sometime has problems with imageswith dark borders. I had this problem with 4 or 5 slides and it requiredplaying around with different modes and options to get around the problem2. The colors in several of my photos/slides of red/orange sunsets did notscan properly. They came out too blue. I could never get Epson orSilverfast to scan them properly. I had to use Photoshop to adjust thecolor and even then it did not correctly match the original.Summary:All in all the V700 scanner and software worked very well and I would recommend it.I did not find the Epson software to be terrible as some reviewers have indicated.I experienced no crashes or serious bugs when using the software. The Abort processing even worked correctly even though that is a feature that often doesn't work properly.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>I chose this item after reading other reviews.  However, I returned it - it is extremely loud, the steam vents out the top, under wood cupboards and I had a very difficult time pouring water in the skinny opening without getting everything wet. It is a good looking pot and made very good coffee.  If these issues aren't deal breakers for you, by all means go for it. By the way, the color is on the front only - so from the side what you see is the frosted/clear area of the water reservoir which goes 3/4 of the way around.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Good product for the price.  The switch worked perfectly.

It actually worked perfect out of the box. So I set it aside and left it on while I went about making a mounting bracket for it.  About 5 minutes later - I noticed when I handled it the housing was quite warm (not hot - but quite warm - not sure if this normal).  Just about the time I finished making a bracket and went to install it - the image started cutting in and out.  Wiggling the wires seems there might be a loose wire in the harness somewhere.  Funny - I did not notice this when I was first playing with it.  Eventually - even if I moved the wire to the point that it would work - the image on the screen was full of diagonal lines and not visible.  It's dead now.  It had a lifespan of about 30 minutes.  Typical Chinese crap.  If you get lucky and get a good one, you get a good deal.  But it's always a crap shoot.  And my luck as a gambler has always been bad.  Buyer beware.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Neat invention, just got it and it does exactly what it says it does, so far.

As for people complaining about not cooling well enough, I think a lot of them are either using it in too large of a space or want to live in a refrigerator over the summer. Im sure that there's a few that are actually deficient, but what I mean is there are always people who want it really cold. I suggest that if you have doubts about its cooling abilities, don't just look at the temperature, look at the humidity too, that's a big part.I looked through the reviews hoping to find something about this, but it seems like i'm the only one, so it could be from something else. But i've noticed that when using the ac excessively (at least 12 hrs a day, if not 24) in the summer, I start to get throat problems. This starts with some irritation but then progresses into a full fledged sore throat. Very annoying. Getting it checked out with the doctor soon, but I went to one before and he didn't seem to see a relationship.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>It has been a year later and still working well.

I didn't realize how it prevents dry skin until after I stopped using it for a few days during the winter.  From my experience, this product doesn't leave an oily film on your face or make you shine for hours under the lights.  Unlike other products, I don't feel like a teenager going thru acne again.The price for the quality is worth it and the amount you need to apply makes the cost per application comparable to other products.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I got tired of sitting on the patio and having nasty flies buzzing everywhere, so I got one of these to try.  It warned that it did have an odor, so I hung it (use wire, it's heavy when you fill it with water) about 15 feet from the patio from a bird feeder hook.  Oh, my gosh.  Within a couple of hours there were already probably 20 flies in there and many more crawling on the bag that hadn't yet figured out how to get in.  But in the morning, they had.  I'm going to buy several more when next summer comes around and hang them along my fence. If you hang them with the logo side away, they don't have anything on the back, and it's not so glaring.  Then when you're finished with the trap, you just push the yellow button back down and throw the whole thing away with no mess.  I highly recommend.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>These socks are comfortable and soft.

The design of the light electrically is very basic and the quality of the soldering inside is very poor. The LED's are all linked in parallel, with one large 2.2 ohm resistor connected in series to limit the current. The stats are these:6V supply (4*1.5V cells)2.2 Ohm resistorLED voltage drop 3.3V-> 2.7v voltage drop on resistor-> 1.2A current!= 3.2 Watts dissipated (wasted) through resistorThis really is no good at all so I changed the internals ever-so-slightly...Where the power connects the the LED PCB, remove the cross-links (actually the legs of one of the LEDs) so the boards are not connected to each other at that point.At the opposite end connect the bottom left track to the top right and remove the other cross-link.And that's it. I've up loaded an image of this for you to refer to.The stats are now these:6V supplyLED voltage drop = 2*2.9V (now 2 sets of 12 LEDs in series)-> 0.2V drop across resistor-> 0.06A current= 0.012 Watts dissipated through resistor.Now the light will be quite a bit dimmer, but now the run-time can be measured in days rather than hours and there'll be absolutely no over heating of the resistor.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>I purchased this toy for my son and he loves it.

I own every film available on DVD, I own the video games, I own quite a few of the soundtracks on CD and I will be the first in line when \"vs. Biollante\", \"vs. Megalon\" and \"1985\" hit DVD and pay whatever is asked just so I can complete my collection. Yes, I can even sit through the Matthew Broderick travesty that bears the name \"Godzilla\".That being said....I'm not sure how anyone, fan or non-fan, can enjoy \"King Kong vs. Godzilla\"???? This film is so astonishingly awful, it veers way off of the \"So Bad It's Good\" track onto the simply horrible realm at about 20 minutes in. I love bad b-movies, I'll sit back and watch \"Mesa of Lost Women\" or \"Eegah\" all day long, but \"Kong vs Godzilla\" is mind numblingly awful. Where to begin....1. King Kong does not look like \"King Kong\". This ratty ape suit looks like it's barely holding together, and the nightmarishly barely animated hand-puppet face used for close ups of the giant ape is grade school level F/X at best.2. While having a strong plot isn't exactly key to a successful Godzilla film, Kong's storyline is so minimal as to not exist. Basically a company has found out these island berries can get you intoxicated, so they want to steal them. Unfortunately they happen to be King Kong's drink of choice as well. So basically the events of the film occur because some Japanese folks and King Kong both want to get high! Godzilla only gets involved because the worlds worst submarine captain doesn't understand that iceburgs don't simply float on top of the water, and that most of the ice is actually below the water's surface, thus ramming his nuclear sub into Godzilla's ice prison.3. The UN / American footage. I don't know if watching the original Japanese version of this film would help much, but the American version with the narrator/UN report guy is amazingly dull. For some reason there is a space station shown, and some maps, a Japanese correspondant who doesn't know how to wear headphones....and everybody is watching the events unfold on a 10\" color TV screen? The American scientist is awful as well, you have to love when he holds up a small gumball and states that it is the size of Godzilla's brain??? What???4. The fight scenes are dull. If nothing else you can usually rely on Toho films to provide some decent monster fights in their films...not so much here. Sure Godzilla and Kong meet for a final showdown about 10 minutes before the film ends...but it's just bad...and worse there really isn't a conclusion.Luckily, Godzilla would go on to much better things after this third entry in the series. I guess as a Godzilla fan I'm happy to have this disk in my collection, I can't imagine I'll pull it out very often (maybe in another 10 years or so?), but as a completist I had to own it.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>Put aside for a minute the fact that Ocean's Twelve was undoubtedly made with the primary purpose of giving its A-list cast an excuse to lounge around in southern Italy for a few months. Put aside also the fact that this is a sequel to the decent (though unspectacular) Ocean's Eleven of a few years ago, which was itself a remake of an earlier (again unmemorable) star vehicle for Frank Sinatra and the Rat Pack. The bloodlines of this franchise have been diluted more than European royalty.Take Ocean's Twelve for what it is: an entertaining heist movie with a fairly porous plot that nevertheless yields some good moments. High art it is not, but I found myself enjoying the ride while it lasted.There are a million reasons why this film shouldn't work, but the cast and crew do manage to pull a competent flick together in between the off-screen debauchery and carousing.

Lacking that one's wealth of enthralling songs, it nevertheless impresses with its own gems like Still Learning How To Crawl, Sleeping In The Devil's Bed and The Unbreakable Chain. The folky song with snatches of French here is The Collection of Marie Claire while Unbreakable Chain, the moving story of a mother and son's reunion, has that same French feel. Another touching song is Lotta Love with its chiming guitars, a tale of addiction and redemption. Indian has Native American drumming and reminds me slightly of Joni Mitchell's Lakota on Chalk Mark In A Rainstorm. The production is magical, as to be expected from Lanois: atmospheric instrumentation - including evocative synths - backing his soulful voice. This is a very good album offering much in the way of stirring, memorable music and Lanois remains true to his vision.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This works great and comes with a warranty.

I wasn't expecting any miracles or a cheap face lift, so when I did see a subtle but noticeable difference, that was good enough for me. The effect isn't long lasting, and is certainly more effective on fine lines -- I know because I also tried it on those deeper furrows between my brows -- and I guess that's why it's marketed for those fine lines around the eyes. Although there is a subtle improvement of those fine lines, the difference just isn't enough to be worth the price, in my opinion. Instead, I'll work at wrinkle prevention by sticking with my Olay moisturizer.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>It was exactly what I was looking for.

NOT a garbage COMMA truck transformer. A waste management garbage truck transformer. I know, just take a minute to let the awesome sink in. Transformer Animate Wreck-gar is a great toy. His color palette of oranges, tomato reds, grays and ochres are a homage to his original G1 character. The truck is nice example of the translation from Animated's visual stylizing to physical toy. I especially the lifting arms gimmick on the front. I only wish the truck windows had been rendered in clear plastic, which shouldn't have been hard to do since it's a solid non transforming facade. (also the headlights and tail lights are transparent plastic with paint apps over them?!)The transformation is easy, but my Wreck-gar is pretty solid when pegged together and stiff in some joints so he might be more difficult for younger hands. Again your Wreck-gar may vary. He basically transforms out of his truck back which becomes a backpack in robot mode. Since it actually *was* a backpack in the show, this is one of the few cases of a backpack-former where it makes sense. I wish the door on the back of his truck mode opened so he could actually use the 'backpack' in robot mode like on the show. But, the storage of his weapons in a hidden pocket kinda make up for the backpack issues Robot mode is sweet. Captures the characterization perfectly down to the little details, crooked smirk, robo-facial hair and antenna on his TV head. Fairly poseable with articulated hands, and the light piping in the eyes works amazingly better than I expected. Oddly he only displays an Autobot symbol in vehicle mode.All in all, Animated Wreck-gar is a good solidly build and cleverly designed figure. I'd recommend for kids, collectors, fans of the show, fans of Weird Al, garbage truck enthusiasts... He originally retailed for about 20 bucks and sometimes goes for around 40 MISB on some sites, but if you can find him for around 20-25 or so he's great quirky bot. \"Dare to be Stupid,\" Indeed!And remember parents: If you don't like challenging your children, BUY AGE APPROPRIATE.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I use it primarily in my laser printer.

The cabinets are installed just inches apart which gave me the expanse I needed at a lower cost than buying the higher end Kohler line.  I think Kohler could do a much better job advising customers of the options available to achieve the look.  Do not buy ganging hardware if you are going to go this route.  Customer service advised me to leave a small gap between the cabinets.  By putting a bit of shiny aluminum on the wall between the cabinets, looks good and almost wall to wall mirrors.

As for longevity, it's too soon to tell</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>IMO, there are two pocketable megazoom cameras on the market with the highest image quality.  They are the Canon SX260 and this Panasonic ZS15.  In addition to high image quality (the most important feature IMO), both cameras are about the same size (large end of pocketable) and both have about the same optical zoom.  However, there are still reasons to choose the Panasonic ZS15.  The main reason for me (and the one most reviewers never mention) is the extra optical zoom up to 25x if you limit the image size to 5 MPix which is large enough for a quality 8x10 inch print.  Then there is an extra 2x zoom for a total of 50x which is apparently an interpolated digital zoom involving a little image quality degradation.  (The camera has a digital zoom in addition to the 50x which I never use.  I can use digital zoom on a computer after the fact.)  So, with 25x true optical zoom and the ability to get a shot at 50x if necessary, this is an amazing camera.  It has aperture and shutter priority settings as well as manual. These features are also important although the intelligent automatic mode (iA) does well in many conditions.  There is also an intelligent resolution feature which adds beautiful sharpness to many photos.  That feature is always present in iA and may be included in the other settings as well.There are three other features that made me choose the Panasonic ZS15.  1. It does not have a GPS which is a power draining option that I never use in a camera.  (I tend to know where my photos were taken - close enough.)  2. It does not shoot RAW which I never do.  3. By omitting features 1 & 2, the price of the Panasonic is significantly below the Canon (typically $70 although prices change frequently.)</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>No screws!

Welcome is one of the most creative disks in the Hard Rock genre. Unfortunately, they took a different direction after Welcome (October 2002) with Blue Sky Research (August 2005).2002's Welcome separated Taproot from the generic Nu Metal infestation of this decade with off-time beats most clearly heard in songs like Everything, Fault and Sumtimes. Poem was Welcome's claim to radio play and it was a great, foot stompin' rocker. There were different styles and sounds to the tunes on Welcome, and the songs didn't have the Nu Metal Nickelback epidemic of not being able to tell when the track has changed.Sure, Taproot clearly was influenced by Alice in Chains. In fact, Toby Wright, Welcome's producer, even co-produced some AiC disks. And singer Stephen Richards has an unmistakably clear singing voice that is a bit similar to the late, great Layne Staley.But Taproot were definitely their own band on Welcome and put out one of the most unique sounding hard rock disks of 2002.Unfortunately, Taproot lost some of their unique sound with Blue Sky Research, and went to the Nickelback monochromatic formula for some odd reason. My guess it was pressure from their label (Atlantic) to take the fun and creativity out of the music and make more radio friendly music (indeed they hired Billy Corgan [Smashing Pumpkins] to help with some of the Blue Sky tracks).This past summer drummer Jarrod Montague revealed on Taproot's MySpace blog that the band had parted ways with Atlantic Records. So hopefully Taproot's 4th release will get back to the music that made them unique and hard.Hard rockers looking for something mostly unique with a bit of an Alice in Chians Dirt influence should absolutely pick up Welcome.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>When we realized that we couldn't use it to make frozen tortoise bites, we just kind of tossed it somewhere.

Great for camping.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Very professional and well-made product.  My wife is an RN, and I gave it to her as a gift.  Since we have three small children of our own, we get good use out of it, as well as for use in her professional career.

So, this product comes with new standards in bluetooth headset (Ultra Light weighted, dual microphones with ultimate noise cancillation, unique feature pause button, If run out of juice you can just use it as mic when charging on stand, single charge 8 hr, less price) , VOICE CLARITY is fantastic....what you want to lisen still absolutely worth a try. you will love it for sure.1) Don't lisen to the people saying high volume its up to you can control the volume in your systemor on headset.2) Don't incert the earbud deep in the ears just a bit that makes you deaf for long term user for this reason earbud made bit large.3) This will work with phones & PC too and amazing performance but need blutooth transmitter(dongal with atleast 2.0+EDR+A2DP transmitter|dongal for pc to work atleast A2DP is must )4) Tested and Works with SKYPE pc version , IMP iphone SKYPE had a problem with app itself I mean the new ver of app but it works with Iphone perfectly and normally amazing clear and load5) I thought it look bigger but truth believe me its a little one and ultra light weighted so you just forget some time the you are wearing it.CONCLUSION : I used BOSE blutooth and I have one I don't say they are not good but this is amazing because it has same high quality performance without compramize but nearly 75% less price. This is'nt bad looking decent, good looking but if you want to make somekind of fashion statement you can go for highly price one</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>If you leave this slightly loose to keep the arm moveable the screws comes loose or binds when you try to move it.

I once tried a non-HP refill system for my cartridge and the quality was just not the same, the ink seemed too watery and took forever to dry. The reason I gave this only 4 stars is because for the price of ink cartridges I think they should provide a little more ink without making you buy an XL to last longer.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>My partner and I love this show.  Not only are the actors pleasant to look at but it deals with real relationship issues that come up in a same sex relationship.

I also own the sheepskin lined leather tool belt, and this is the perfect addition.  My toolbelt was not designed to go with these suspenders so they did require some minor modification in order to use them.  My pouches do not have a continous belt so the loops that the suspenders come with do not just slide on.  I had to drill out the rivits on the loops and drill some holes in my pouches and rivit the metal part of the loop to my pouches.  I placed the rivits slightly out of center as to favor my left-side pouches.  I use that side more so it is very convienient. All the other guys on the site are extremely jealous.  These pouches (combined with my tool belt) scream &#34;Professional&#34;.  They are a little stiff in the beginning but feel incredibly durable.  I had already started to experience some severe lower back pain at times and these suspenders really take the pressure off of the lower back. My lower back dosen't feel as fatigued at the end of the day and it actually seems to make my upper back and shoulders stronger. They feel worked-out, but in a good way.One piece of advice is to follow the instructions.  They come with a pair of screw rivits to affix the leather straps to the canvas material near the middle back area.  This is so that black part of the harness does not slide back or forth on the leather straps.  WEAR THEM FOR ABOUT TWO WEEKS, before securing the straps with the screw rivits.  It just takes a little while to determine exactly where you want them.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This polish is so much more beautiful in person! It sparkles a beautiful bright gold color!

I have eczema on my upper arms and within two days this product took care of it, as in they are soft and smooth. I also use this on my face a lot. I tend have some mild rosacea on my cheeks and acne-prone skin. I use my facial anti-aging serium and then put a layer of this over my whole face and neck for moisture. After a few minutes, I then put an extra amount on my cheeks where I have the rosacea and it smooths it out and calms it down. This product has AHAs in it, so I'm surprised it didn't cause me to flare up.  As I said, I also use this on my neck, where I have always had rough, bumpy skin, and it smooths it into buttery softness. It does leave a bit of a 'tacky' feeling for a few hours, but I only use it at night. I REALLY wish Eucerin would make this exact product (NO SPFs as they irritate my skin beyond belief!) into a face lotion that absorbs well into facial skin (it's non-comodonogenc so it does not exactly absorb into the skin, but sits on top more). I've tried some of their face lotions and was not that impressed. I think Eucerin needs to approach their face lotions from their current line of body moisturizers and tweak them slightly. I want my facial moisturizer to be super moisturizing, have urea in it, have anti-aging benefits, and feel like I have nothing on it at all. Not asking much, I know!!  But, I know it's possible and I know Eucerin can do it because they have made a magical product in this moisturizer. For the record, I hate their original body lotion!  It's greasy and doesn't seem to do much to help my skin out. Give this a try!  If you hate it, you can always use it on your feet, it makes them super soft too!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>love the company.  love the ingredients.  my 2 yr old loves them, and asks for them too  definitely recommend this multi</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>The cap fits perfectly on my mid to large sized head.The material is well crafted (it holds it shape and cleans well), the colors are nice and contrasty, and the design is stylish (if you are into the skateboard and related subcultures).The size adjustments on the back cover a wide range of sizes, so I believe the claims of this cap being one size.A great addition for your cap collection.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I'm starting to focus more on my artwork, but hadn't really gotten any experience with coloring my work.  I've found that the tablet has made it a lot easier to learn (since you can undo mistakes with the click of a button) and explore different styles without going through tons of paper/supplies.I'd only recommend a drawing tablet if you have some experience though.  It's better to learn the basics with a real pencil.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I got organic cotton breastpads originally thinking I'd save $$ and the hassle of having to re-buy pads over and over.  After a few nights of waking up with those soaked through and shirt and sheets wet, I decided to try several disposables.  I liked these the best of all.  Even if I wake up after 6 hours (my baby sleeps now that long at night), the pads are really full but no leaking!  And what's best is while I know they are full of milk, I don't feel wet.  I still use the cotton pads while at home during the day, but use these at night and when going out.  Very happy!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I was like so many other people who were led to believe that the Excalibur dehydrator was the best one. Maybe it's really great, but this dehydrator, which costs approximately half of the Excalibur price after figuring in all the add-ons necessary to get it working, actually has the same features, and dare I say: even more.This model has ten trays. The Excalibur has nine. This model comes with two nonstick liners and a device to close off four trays' width for times when you want to take them out to place rising dough or culturing yogurt in it instead. You need to buy those things at extra cost for the Excalibur model.  Neither model has a timer. Both models have adjustable temperature.The STX does not heat up my kitchen. That's really nice since I prefer to dehydrate rather than cook during the 105+ degree summer weather. It takes up a large part of my biggest counter. I planned on that, so for me it's not a hardship. I just made extra space on my other counters.I have had this machine running continuously for five days now, since a couple of days after I got it. When I first turned it on it exuded a burning sort of smell, which concerned me. In the manual it says to run it for 45 minutes at 95 degrees. So I did that, and after approximately 5 minutes the smell went away. It hasn't come back since. It is also very quiet. I believe the people who say this machine is noisy have never owned a dehydrator before. I owned a Nesco model from the late 1990's. Now that thing was noisy! This one sounds like running a small fan, which is mostly what it is. No, it's not pretty. It looks very utilitarian, and it is.I would advise anyone who is looking at the Excalibur and shaking their head at the expense to try this dehydrator. It really works nicely.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Maybe a little sweeter than I prefer, but the crowd at work loved them. It makes, making cookies, fast and easy.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>In reading the reviews about this lens I really started to want one for my Canon EOS, but then I realized that for about the same money, my S95 Powershot gives me similar lens capabilities and it's a self contained camera with excellent ISO range.  Probably isn't going to give quite the image quality that this lens will, but it's very impressive.  I think if you're considering buying this lens and you're not a pro and don't like lugging around a your big DSLR all the time you will love the S95.  Don't get me wrong, I still want the 28mm too!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>my kids love these on their bikes and they were cheap too. Not too noisy either. it was worth the money</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>I kind of feel it is not fair of me to post such a low score because I did not keep the keyboard.  Obviously I didn't realize it at the time but it did not serve my purpose as I needed something that would connect to my ipad so I could use as a single unit (think small laptop) and for that reason this just didn't fit what I was looking; I did however purchase another version where of the Anker product that served as a hard case as well as a key board and I really like it.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>The bands that come with this set are similar quality to what we use for rehab and personal training where I work.  They are a great set of bands for the price.  The chin up bar is pretty solid, although I haven't used it yet because it was missing one bolt to complete the assembly.  Easier to just go to home depot and find one to match it.  But the construction of the chin up bar is solid and I'm excited to get it up and use it. It's much better than one of those plain old bars you mount in the doorway, it was has the opportunity to do a variety of hand placements and therfore work differnet muscle groups.  All in all, I'm glad I purchased this product, wouldn't take it back.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>It has been two weeks using it, but so far no hiccup anything.

It is rock...</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I currently have last generation Panasonic 3D glasses, as well as Xpand X103's and this blow both of them out of the water.  Extremely light weight, the lenses seem to be a little brighter, and they have the ability to convert 3D images back to 2D if you are watching with a group of people and decide you want to watch it in 2D instead.  Will definitely be replacing my other glasses with these over the next few weeks.  The only downside to these that I have found, is they do not come with a storage case, and they don't fit in the last generation storage case.  I haven't found anything that they fit in just right to keep from the lenses getting scratched.</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>A giant POS that does not work. I guess you get what you pay for, right? Or in this case...you pay for nothing.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>The bulk packing of this product made me wonder if this cheap-light weight-looking device really works...It does!! (Though I don't know how long... sorry...but the looking and feeling of this product is not giving me too much confidence)For people who wants to know if it charges your ipad at same time ... it does not (I use ipad 3).</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I had this bottle for at least six months now and I got to say, it works great. Here are some Pros that I found:1) The bottle is affordable.2) The bottle is durable. It is made out of plastic, but it is hard plastic that returns to its original shape when you squeeze it.3) It looks great. The bottle itself looks very sleek and shiny, making it nice to take anywhere from your house, to work, gym, when you are running, and everything in between. I personally use it when going to gym and when I am in my college dorm.4) The water tastes great. I hate the water in my college dorm. It tastes horrible. With this, I can't taste that awful chlorine or as I call it \"pipe\" taste.5) The tether that you can use to carry your bottle with one finger is attached to the cup. When you unscrew the cap, you can either push the cap down where it is attached to the bottle, making it easier to drink your water, or you can pull it all the way up and hold it with your hand while drinking.6) The little filter indicator under the filter lets you set a month when you bought your filter so you will know when to change it again (every 3 months or so, depending on your usage).7) A gentle squeeze gets a lot of water going through the filter, and the filter allows air to go in after you let go of the bottle. This is pretty quiet.I am very happy with this bottle. I think it makes the water taste great and I've noticed I drink a lot more water now, which is always a plus.</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>For the money, not the best quality - I would think again about purchasing this product.  Material is thin and may not hold up too well.  Received this tool box as a gift.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I hesitated at first to buy this after reading some of the negative reviews from others but saw there was room for misunderstanding by people who tried to use this for grinding large nuts and non-oily grains which it was never designed to process. Pumpkin seed kernels are marginally too large. It is made to grind poppy seeds and works equally well for similar seeds like sesame, flax, chia... and you can mix-in fractional amounts of dry spices like black pepper, nigella, sichuan pepper, annato, lemon peel, garlic granules, etc. If you mistakenly try to grind almonds the first large nut into the grinder mechanism will push the screw feeder to one side where it could jam and will cause excessive wear. The small seeds by contrast distribute themselves in the grinder and create a lubricating layer between the inner and outer surfaces. This mill can be a tool to change your diet to include many tasty, healthy spices and seeds.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Bought this for my 2013 Ford F150 with 6.5 foot bed.

As I ran through the house grabbing my coffee and looking for my keys, I hastily placed an order for more deodorant (with next day shipping). When it arrived, I realized that I had ordered Degree Clinical Protection instead of Secret Clinical Strength. Oops.I assumed that they are both made by people in white lab coats and work basically the same for people who need a little extra help in the scent control department. But, I found that the Degree deodorant lasted much longer than the Secret I had been using. Not only did I still feel fresh at the end of the day (after spending two hours commuting in August), I felt reasonably dry and smell free after walking several miles at the gym that evening.The scent is very clean but not overpowering. It simply smells fresh. Also, I was able to wear it with a black shirt and not find any stains or smudges (this has to be attributed to the product and not user skill).The only thing that I noticed is that the product that I received is slightly different than the one pictured. This might be a simple change in packaging. The one I received also says \"24H MotionSense Motion Activated Freshness\" and I don't see that in the product that is pictured.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>it is very very cool but the little metal holding the periodic table from going in the pen falls off and the paper gets bend up a little but it is pretty good</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>I purchased this item at the very end of August 2011 and I am currently running a disk check on it because S.M.A.R.T. said that a failure is imminent.

Included on almost every important \"Best of\" list for 1976, Eastwood's amazing cinematic masterpiece was all but snubbed by the Academy. That he was finally recognized for the much-inferior \"Unforgiven\" is a shameful irony. The western genre was in decline by the 1970s and had largely devolved into cliche or cartoonish parody. The genius of Eastwood's vision was to take traditional western stereotypes and turn them on their heads, demythologize the rigidly black/white good-vs-evil Saturday matinee morality, and show us characters with real depth, real motivations and real inner conflicts; not always \"good\" or always \"bad\" but sometimes walking a fine line, driven to one side or the other by circumstances beyond one man's control. The look of the film is gorgeous, showing us a smokey, autumnal by-gone world, sometimes crude, often gritty. It's not clear we'd want to live in such a time or place, but we are drawn in nonetheless. Wonderful acting, and a whole passel of great character actors, including the inimitable Chief Dan George, bring the story to vibrant life. There's plenty of action to keep the adrenaline flowing, and the story draws to a logical, satisfying, if artfully understated, conclusion. The score is also worthy of note; spare and expansive all at once, it ranks as one of the best to come out of the 1970s. This is absolutely-must-see.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>when i ordered these i was looking for a 4mm crystal bead and these are not true to size as all of the other 4 mm beads i use. they are slightly larger then the other beads. while they still work fine for what i am making i just would have liked to have known before i purchased and i would have bought a different one.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>This charger is great.

So when I found this I put a healthy splash on my plate and dove right in. I was GREATLY surprised!! This sauce is quite hot for a little bottle I found next to Sriracha! It caught me off-guard and is even hotter than some Scorpion pepper sauces! This is the real deal and has GREAT taste! By far recommended over anything else.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>words just DO NOT do this album justice. these guys rock. hard. they're an awesome live band.

I got a bluetooth speaker I've been using in the shower for months and had it running off my phone which sits at my computer desk, and for $9 I figured I'd be able to drop the hassle of switching between my computer and phone for music when I took a shower and have a more seamless audio experience (when I disconnect the bathroom speaker and get out, the computer speakers would pick back up).  Unfortunately, the dongle seems to be good for about 10 feet of range and starts stuttering at 15.  At 20 feet in the bathroom with the door wide open, it's simply unusable, akin to streaming music over a dialup connection.  When it connects.So if you need a bluebooth connection for devices that will sit a foot or two away, or even 10, I'm sure the product works fine, but falls well below the standard of 30 feet.  For comparison, I've never had music from my phone skip which, as stated, sits on my computer desk so same distance.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>This Oster hand mixer is nothing special. Putting it blatantly.Jumping right in, let's look at the beaters. Easy to click in, hard to get off. Also, they seem to be on the shorter side.It doesn't offer much power. Simple cookie doughs I've found defeat this mixer. Not just defeat, mind you, but beats it to the point that it smells as if the motor is about to catch fire. Oh, and lets not forget the smoke while all that's going down.The speed settings are nice but when you really get down to it, 6 speeds is a bit much. A simpler 3 speed with more power would have been more desired. The differences from 2 to 3, or 4 to 5 aren't that significant.Finally, the cord is a little short. You gotta be close to an outlet or else you won't be using this bad boy without an extension cord, which seems a bit ridiculous.All in all, yes, this does come with a nice bowl and lid that makes for easy and neat storage but it just comes up too short in the power department to warrant a purchase from someone actually looking to do any amount of real cooking with it. Pass.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I've always loved this 1938 Shirley Temple film, which bears little or no relationship to thechildren's book of the same name.  Shirley plays a talented orphan, Rebecca Winstead, who wins a radio contest, and despite some twists and turns in the plot, eventually finds stardom in New York.  The film closes with Shirley and Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson in a great tap routine to Raymond Scott's hit, \"The Toy Trumpet.\"  William Demarest, Gloria Stuart, Jack Haley, and Randolph Scott are among the featured character actors in the film.This film - in both B&W; and colorized versions - is a must-have for Temple fans of all ages.  It features English fake stereo and mono soundtracks, a Spanish soundtrack, and subtitles in both languages.  Enjoy.This is the last Shirley Temple movie that I will review, as I don't intend to buy any more, unless POOR LITTLE RICH GIRL finally makes it to U.S. DVD. R.I.P., dear Shirley...</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Did a transfer of old 650GB drive to this 2TB moinster. Would not install as instrcuted until I check on the error code I was getting with Segate wedsite and found I had disk errors that needed to ne fixed on the old HD. Worked like a charm after that. I love it!</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>very cute baby pink color. fit/cut is not perfect, sometimes I have trouble pressing on/off button. easy to put on and take off.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>A client gave me my first bottle many years ago and I have used it exclusively since.  It is a wonderful fragrance; I always get compliments on it.  Although this is a toilette, it still has staying power.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>The screen protector for the case will be scratched if you use the squeagy that is included with this package. Also its very easy for the plug that covers the charging port to be stretched out or bent the wrong way.  Not the best craftsmenship but it will provide protection around the edges of the phone.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>This is the cheapest fisheye lens I could find on amazon. I had trouble choosing which fisheye lens (Opteka, Bower, Rokinon), mostly because I thought that ten more dollars more for the Opteka lens would get me a better lens. However, I found out that the fisheye lenses are actually made from the same company, but have other names on them (Opteka, Bower, Rokinon). This was the wisest decision I made (the extra ten dollars got me one day shipping).The lens itself is quite heavy, heavier than my nikkor 18-55 and 55-200. I didn't let that bother me. I don't want to get into technical specs, so the only thing I have to say is this fisheye lens does not have vignetting. Some people like that, some people don't.  The distortion isn't that of a \"true\" fisheye.  Without the vignetting and the distortion of a \"true\" fisheye, this lens is a wide angle lens and a fisheye lens. I was also trying to decide to invest more on a wide-angle lens rather than the fisheye, but with this package I got both. This lens by far was the best decision I made. This lens a  two in one piece of glass.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>A number of my lady friends have expressed the desire to get this wine coaster.  It looks classy and it's very useful.  The finish is nice.  The weight is of good quality.  It has great styling.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Have used this in the past for my acrylic displays cases. Drys quickly with maximum adhesion. Highly recommended if you are working with acrylics. Great service from vendor I had it before the scheduled delivery time.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Item fit just as well as a factory original. The screw holes lined up perfectly and the product is sealed very well to prevent leakage. Price was right and very fast shipping.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I had bought plenty of the other kind that is plastic.  After getting this set with the glassware, I like this much better. With usage, this doesn't change shape like the other.</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>My yard project experienced over a ten-percent structural failure rate on Orbit bubblers I purchased, and an additional fifteen percent no-flow rate when installed.  Really discouraging to have to re-do all this work.  I didn't have a good experience with these.</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>it cut my hair. How do you use it to grow yours? i use 1 tbsp of powder with 4 oz of oil. What went wrong? i also had headaches</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>My husband was buying individual shakes everyday at the convenience store. Expensive. Now he mixes his own shakes and uses o.j., and fresh fruit!!

Fits great, just like a Trojan</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>Might as well have ordered a brick. Arrived, batteries in... power and lights work, but no sound from the speakers or earphone jack at all.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Item was shipped timely but took a while to arrive----several days longer than advertised.  It appears that this company ships in bulk by DHL to a regional postal facility where the shipment is broken down for shipment to individual addresses.  Don't know if they are really saving money but it sure slows down the shipping time.  Item works fine and you can't argue with the price!  Company communicates in a timely manner and responds to email inquiries quickly.  I'd buy from them again!</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>I got this because I have an older Roku XD in my kitchen, and a small TV -- I watch shows while I'm cooking or doing dishes.  I wanted one universal remote to control both items, and this one does the job very well.  The only downside is that the programming process is a little on the tedious side (you have to hold X button while pushing Y button, then wait for Z seconds, then punch in a code, etc., etc.), and each device you could use it for has several potential four-digit codes.  You have to use trial and error to see which code works, and trying a new code requires starting the entire procedure from the start.  Once you get it programmed, though, it works like a charm.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I don't know how I happened upon this product, but I love it.  I started taking vitamin D3 several years ago, and my levels were dismally low.  It took quite a long time to build them back to normal, and most likely because I was taking relatively low doses, orally.  This product delivers a more appropriate adult dose and is meant to be dissolved under the tongue, which I understand is a better delivery method than swallowing capsules.  The vitamin K2 is not only an added bonus because most adults are deficient, but allows for better absorption of the D3.  The taste is extremely pleasant, and is almost a &#34;treat&#34; every day.  Would highly recommend and have been taking it myself with nothing but favorable results for the past year.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>They arrived even more quickly than promised. They were just what I needed to get started on a bit weaving project.

Total crap, that worked at first now nothing.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>It's hard to find a decent scale.  Many are junk which take expensive batteries and they are inconsistent with the weight they reportNo problems with this scale. The Eatsmart scale beats them all hands down:1) It has a nice quality feel to it2) It has been spot on accurate/consistant - it's exactly what I need for my weight loss program3) It take regular AA batteries4) Nice big numbers with high contrast make reading the results easy w/o having to bend down or squint5) Can't beat the price for this high quality scale.I've very happy with my purchase.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This strap is great for carrying my extra-large laptop  bag (which of course always has a bunch of other heavy stuff in it).One slight niggle - the tag ends of the strap are always fl.opping around loose. Wish there were loops or something to get them out of the way. I might be doing something wrong, of course.Still, 5 stars.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Our family has played this game a number of times, and I doubt it will ever grow old. The basic game is similar to the old parlor game, where each player has to repeat what all the players have said up to him/her, then add a new word beginning with the next letter in the alphabet. This game is a lot more fun, though, because there are cards that tell each player what to do or say. Some are to act like a certain animal (silently or with sound effects), others are to say a phrase, others to act out a certain motion. I lost last time, because although I remembered to say, \"Seriously,\" then scratch my head, then imitate the sound and motion of a snake, then pretend to swim, then say, \"Gotcha!\" then take my own pulse, and then howl at the moon like a wolf, alas I forgot that the next item in the list was to pretend to juggle. My two 10-year olds beat me 10 to 9 to zero. At first, I thought the game was so simple that for adults it might best be considered a drinking game, but after that (and other) humiliation(s) I think I'll rest up and stay cold sober in the future.There is a board and a little piece for each player that moves around, depending on how well the player does, and there is nominally a \"winner,\" but really nobody cares much about that aspect, at least they shouldn't. The real value of the game is in the cards that give such a large variety of words and actions to remember. It's a good thing there are several hundred cards!It's probably worth noting that the game is geared completely towards having fun, and the directions, while complete, are quite casual (nobody \"loses\" or \"fails,\" they just \"mess up.\"). However, the game is quite educational too, as it helps concentration and (alert: non-scientific opinion coming) maybe makes people use different parts of their brains as they remember totally different types of things--verbal, visual, and auditory. That's really why I think the game will never grow old, as the sequences and significances of the things players need to remember will always be different, even though each individual card will eventually reappear. Players, especially kids, will grow better and faster at this and other memory tasks, as well.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I couldn't find this color in stores so I opted to buy online. I love the rosy nude color. Perfect for everyday wear.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Many times when I install current wifi cards from various maufactures in desktop computers the onboard Cat5/ethernet port will interfere or disable after install and restart. Support for motherboard can sometimes be difficult to find. Installing this card (provided there is an available PCI slot) allows bypassing the motherboard port and allows either wifi or cabled connection with ease to network or internet at 10/100/1000 speeds. Simple install and Win XP/Vista/7 instant driver upgrade makes this port available imediately for use with no conflict. Excellent and easy upgrade for this price.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>It is very entertaining. I wish the show was still going on. It does not have profanity which is awesome</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>so jumped from 25 dollars to 74. Nice, not even any good reviews. lots of complaints on it leaking. Yup, never buying this item thats for sure. Im not even close to impressed.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Bought this adjustable arm when wear and tear on my car dictated that I couldn't use a fixed/length arm.  Part is relatively easy to install, and VERY easy to adjust.  Not to mention, considerably cheaper than other brands.  I honestly don't see any deficiencies in this part that would indicate any other brand would've served any better for a higher cost.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>The mechanics of this cutter are nice, especially the blade shield to keep your fingers from being cut when not in use. However, I found it to be very difficult to cut perfect circles with this cutter. The blade seems to have a little bit of wobble to it.</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>I will try this product again when I put up corn today.  It was awkward  to use.  I think that it might be the position of the handle that is the problem.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This little boom mic stand gives you enough length to place the mic where you want it, and the base is heavy enough that it can balance even when the boom is fully extended.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I use this on my table saw, lathe and other tools to control rust.  Does an excellent job on tools in an unheated space..</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>My folding bike came from the factory with 20 x 1.5 Primos.  I did have a choice in the matter, but had heard good things about them on internet forums, and was anxious to try them out, so I went for it.  I was really happy with the sweet ride and easy rolling of those tires, but wanted to try these skinnies for a round.  Meh, way too bumpy for me.  When they wear out, I`ll go back to those delicious 1.5 Comets.  Being stuck with this 1.35 version for the rest of that bike`s life wouldn`t be HORRIBLE, but I liked the wider version so much better that I see no reason to buy more of these.  All in all, nice tire, but gimme the big `uns!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Well built to stand the test of time (and the nutcracker is built strong as well!!!).I don't care WHO you are. This Hillary Nutcracker gets the conversation(s) going, and in a funny, lighthearted way.Want someone in the White House that doesn't have to prove how tough she is?Send one of these to every member of Congress and the Senate, then just stand back a chuckle at the knucklehead(s) that thought it was a joke............Hopefully, this will eventually end up in the Smithsonian !!!</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>This mat is a nice large size and the cats don't seem to mind it at all.  It does catch some of the litter, but not all.  I sweep it clean every day.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Easy to clean and cart from kitchen to table. Love that it includes a spoon and tray. Boston Warehouse has a bunch of these awesome porcelain kitchen items. Also bought a gorgeous fish water pitcher.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>Nice, but not great.  Sturdy/solid and made of pretty good quality materials (steel and real wood)!  With the metal framework it looks classy and is better than a lot of cheap manufactured-wood shelf units. Most of the welds are done well, but a couple of the welded pieces were just a touch out of place.  The lower basket section was pretty rusted.  The paint was chipped and missing from parts of that one metal section, but since the unit has kind of an antique/rustic look (and that part is down low with the unit setting in a dark corner), it doesn't seem to ruin the looks of it unless you look very closely.  Assembly was hindered by a couple of framework holes that were a little out of place, and with the parts being made of steel it wasn't easy to persuade them to come together.  Packaging was very beat-up, though no shipping damage to the contents was evident.  The Styrofoam chunks were crushed in several places and made an awful mess as the parts were unpackaged.  It may be a little over-priced at $183, but I guess they have to pay for the free shipping somehow.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>My brother got one of these for me about a year ago and I use it almost daily, I bought this one as a present and the people love it.  There is very little mess to clean up after using it, just a cup and the blade.  Much nicer than hauling out my big blender when I only want one or two cups of something mixed.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Our of 24, only 2 arrived cracked. So, you know, what are you going to do with a busted lollipop but eat it, and it tasted good. These are perfect for a child party....cute and festive, functional and inexpensive. I would buy them again.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Boxer puppy loves this ball!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This routet bit is exactly the bit I was shopping for.  It arrived in a reasonable time frame. Packing was good.  Will buy again in the future.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This headset has stood the test of time. Still going strong over a year later. I use this on conference calls all day and what I like about it is the long battery life</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Why did it take half my life to find something like this machine? I don't get it. For an initial round of clay/compound/polish and wax took me 8 hours and a sore back. But when looking at the results...unbelievable. I am so proud of the job done. What I appreciate especially is that at no point I felt like I could create any damage to my car. When cleaning the cutting pads from the compound with a brush the pad will fly away when the speed is set to 5. So you may want to reduce that to 3 or so prior to the cleaning procedure.I definitely recommend this product to anyone who has fun to do those jobs by yourself. Tip: Make sure to watch the how-to videos at the Meguiairs website as they have helped me a lot before doing my first car.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Comfortable, light and great protection! What more can you ask from sunglasses. Comes with a case, neckcord and cleaning cloth.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>No, I wasn't expecting an Apple cover. However, with the screen protector (sold separately) installed, I don't see the need for the high dollar Apple Smart cover.This does just what I need it to do, protects the iPad from unwanted scratches in transit or storage. The stands are an added bonus (although I haven't used them yet, perhaps I will soon).My iPad fits perfectly, the cutouts align with the ports on the iPad fine.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>AC Adapter Charger works. It's cheap and it does the job. What more could I want? Word, word, word, word.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I use this for my beta fish.  I have to remove the shell, but the inside is easy to pull out and they eat all of it.  Some of the other products that are sun dried are empty inside and all hard shell and unusable.  One of my beta's is so picky and he really likes this food.  It also doesn't have alot of powdery loose waste with it.  You get almost all shrimp.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>order the fan at the same time as the replacement motor. Was charged two different shipping fees.Fan was lighter then motor and the shipping charge was over twice as much. Must have something to do with size.But the fan worked with motor so I can be to upset.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Easy to use buttons, keeps good time and a real boon for boaters and swimmers. Great product and looks good, too.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This movie was excellent. It met ALL the expectations I thought it would. I thank Spike Lee for this.. Not only did it tell us or teach us about the system(economy) but it showed us how HARD things get when your country let you down. It was very emotional at times. But overall: I rate it 5*</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I was having some initial stages of Carpal Tunnel for so much using the mouse and that's how I started considering switching to a trackball. I actually stumbled on this product at an Office Max store. I checked Amazon and their price was better. So I bought one and tried it. It took me less than a week to get used to the trackball and I simply fell in love with it. The fact that it has the same buttons as a regular mouse makes the transition a lot easier. Within a week, my wrist wasn't in pain anymore. So I bought a second one and I keep one at the office and the other one with my personal laptop. I love that I can use regular batteries for it (1 AA). The USB transmitter can be kept inside the battery compartment, which prevents you from misplacing it or losing it when travelling with it. I also love the range: I can control the pointer from across the room. My previous wireless mouse didn't have such a good range. For some people the range may be unimportant, but for people like me who sometimes have to facilitate presentations, a great range helps when you are not standing next to the computer. I have recommended this product to some of my friends and they also fell in love with it. I highly recommend it if you are looking to switch from a mouse to a trackball or if you are trying to replace another trackball model.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>So I have been searching for bedding for months and the down comfortors are so expensive that i decided to just go with the down alternative. Well i found this one and the price agreed with me and i liked the reviews for the most part. I placed my order and it came the NEXT DAY! I was super excited to get home and see my new warm comforter.. When i opened it up it was thinner than i expected and at night i get cold, its not very breathable. The outter shell is not like a traditional down blanket either, it is some synthetic fiber. Its a worth it purchase i guess, but it just wasn't what i was searching for exactly.</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>My skin became red and irritated and I had the worst break out in years after use of this product.I've never had any sort of allergy or reaction like that to any makeup of any sort until I used this!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>The Galaxy S3 locates the NFC antennae on the battery.

Extremely disappointed!!!However, as far as being here on time...and packaged well..no complaints  there...</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>I received this set as a birthday present. I am a beginner makeup lover and have been wanting a full set of brushes for sometime now. I like the set, but there is no list of what each brush is supposed to do. For a novice like myself, that is not a good thing. I opened the leather pouch to a full set of brushes, many of which looked like they do the same thing. It would be nice if there was a guide on each brush was and its purpose. Not only so makeup babies can feel like they know what they are doing, but also to make sure you got what you paid for. It's just okay, but I will be looking for another set as I get more advanced with my makeup skills. Not completely satisfied.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>These are just O.K. It came in a set of 3 and I've gone through 2 and can not get all the air pockets out of it. I would not buy again.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Needed a punk rock wig last minute and this worked and was inexpensive. This was a $10 (about) wig and that is what it was worth. It is thin, with some blue strands, and comes in a package so hair is flat.  This was a great wig for the price and fast delivery (with Prime).</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I really like the fit and comfort of this brace. I tore my MCL in both knees. Luckily neither was a complete tear. Wearing these braces has really helped me to get back into things. It has been 2 weeks since the injuries and I have had the braces for 10 days. I even skied with them for 3 hours 1 week after the injury (NOT recommended). I wouldn't recommend Dodge ball either. It is very rough on the knees. I wear the braces everyday at work and play. They are much more comfortable than others I have tried. I like the neoprene support of some other braces, but I couldn't stand wearing that thick tight neoprene for 12 hours a day. The support of these feels firm and stable but allows more movement throughout a long day. Even when I have to sit a lot at work, these are still comfortable.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Product was exactly as it was described and the shipping got it here in no time flat.  I've had these types of water bottles before and for the abuse I subject them to steel is the only way to go.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>My new go-to when on-the-go bar!!  Delicious, healthy choice and you can't beat the price when you purchase by the case.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Wow !!!  this stuff is awesome. I'm considering building a house with it (just kidding). Only complaint is the nozzle on top. As others have reported,, it clogs up and needs a different delivery system.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This is a pretty neat product for anyone who likes the old Polaroid photos.  The photos printed on this system kind of have that retro, Polaroid look, but I like it.  They remind me of instagrams (and you can put a border around them like an old Polaroid). They work out to about $.60/print which is not a bad price. Polaroid film was expensive back in the day too.  I wish the prints were a little bigger, but the printer fits perfectly in my camera bag.

I used it 1-2 times, and that's it.  It IS heavy; not so much that you're lifting weights, but it IS weighted; I don't see why this is a good thing.  So if you have delicate curls and tiny knots, you can easily break off your curls instead of combing through them with the extra weight; so you have to use extra care with this comb.  And that's just it; this comb isn't meant for small curls.  Each tooth of the comb is thick, so if you're prone to tiny knots, this comb definitely won't work through them...unless destruction equates detangling...if the the hair is gone, then you're definitely knot-free!Also, the teeth are not staggered on each side of the comb; they're just copied/paralleled. So whatever hair you just combed gets combed again in the same place.  If the teeth were staggered, it would be more effective.I would only use this comb if my hair was already tangle-free/knot free, there wouldn't be a problem with small knots.  But if you have big curls, then maybe the comb will work well for you.  My curls are 3C with some 3B, ~3/8 of an inch in diameter; they make ringlets or ripples depending on the product (or lack of) in my hair.  Especially with small ringlets/tendrils, I need smaller teeth to comb through them.I used bakelite/bone combs and a Denman brush; the smaller the knot, the smaller the teeth that I use.  In fact, I don't see why anyone would even need a tangle-teezer when a denman brush can achieve the same results if you use lighter pressure...but maybe I should try one, a TT that is?And then, there's the old finger combing when my hair is unbearably knotty...in more ways than one!  ;-\"Behave hair, beHAVE!\"  \"Tame the mane!\"But my routine 1x-2x a week is to...1)finger comb - tiny knots/or for just QUICK detangling and then SKIPPING steps 2-4!2)bone comb - regular knots3)denman brush - brush out loose, dead hair; stimulate scalp.4)regular sized bone comb (wider space between teeth w/ bigger teeth) - comb all hair in the style/direction that I  want it to dry in.Not all curly hair is created equal...nor are all knots.

I looked at the otterbox case but it got pretty awful reviews so I ended up getting this one instead. It turned out to be a great purchase. It only took me a minute or two to put it on and it holds together very well. There's some slight squeaking of the plastic along the right side in one area on mine that occurs whenever you pick the iPad up but it doesn't really bother me. The only downside of this case, which some of the other reviews have pointed out, is that the silicon part covering the home button sticks occasionally. In order to make it click the actual home button again you have to pry that silicon piece up and then gently push it back in. Overall this isn't that big of a deal for me because it only sticks every now and again and it takes a whole of half a second to fix it but it is a slightly annoying occurrence for such an expensive case. It does add substantial weight but that kind of goes with this kind of case's territory. Even with its few problems it gives me piece of mind about potentially dropping it (even though I haven't do to the grippy covering) which is all I really wanted in an iPad case.Also, A+ for Gumdrop customer service. I sent them an email about the home button sticking and 10 minutes later they emailed me back. They're releasing a version 2 of this case that fixes the home button sticking issue, (on August 28th I believe),  and are sending me one to replace the one I have.",1311292800,"Gumdrop Cases Drop Tech Series Case for Apple iPad 2- Black-Black","A15BCIDJNLIALL"],["B003BQ6QXK","ToiletTree Products",[0,0],"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/411rroTN2FL._SY300_.jpg",29.95,4.0,"A little annoying to install at first but worth the time.You do have to fill with water for each use and then dump out the water but it works great.",1359244800,"Fogless Shower Mirror with Squeegee by ToiletTree Products.

It tells you if there is a newer version available for download and allows you to do that if you desire.  It talks about version numbers, but of course if you do not have anything installed yet you don't know what version you have in your CD drive.  Printed on the CD it tells you it's Version 5 but only that is has SP4  (service pack 4) and not the full numeric version that the web site gives you.Go clear to the bottom of the drop down list and you'll see \"no software installed yet\" to get full versionNo real problem, but can cause you to waste some time double checking to avoid mistakes etc.They also want you to set up an account and register the scanner before you can enter the product code supplied with download.This seems like it will be a very good system to use from input to lookup/print/export.  You can select several different formats for reports to print and/or save.Smooth and quiet scanning using only USB power so no AC adapter to fool with.  Although, I will only be using it while my notebook is on AC power , notebook batteries don't last long enough as is without running scanner motors.Size should fit in any briefcase, computer case, suitcase etc.  and wonders of wonders... the USB 2.0 cord is 5 feet long !

I used it 1-2 times, and that's it.  It IS heavy; not so much that you're lifting weights, but it IS weighted; I don't see why this is a good thing.  So if you have delicate curls and tiny knots, you can easily break off your curls instead of combing through them with the extra weight; so you have to use extra care with this comb.  And that's just it; this comb isn't meant for small curls.  Each tooth of the comb is thick, so if you're prone to tiny knots, this comb definitely won't work through them...unless destruction equates detangling...if the the hair is gone, then you're definitely knot-free!Also, the teeth are not staggered on each side of the comb; they're just copied/paralleled. So whatever hair you just combed gets combed again in the same place.  If the teeth were staggered, it would be more effective.I would only use this comb if my hair was already tangle-free/knot free, there wouldn't be a problem with small knots.  But if you have big curls, then maybe the comb will work well for you.  My curls are 3C with some 3B, ~3/8 of an inch in diameter; they make ringlets or ripples depending on the product (or lack of) in my hair.  Especially with small ringlets/tendrils, I need smaller teeth to comb through them.I used bakelite/bone combs and a Denman brush; the smaller the knot, the smaller the teeth that I use.  In fact, I don't see why anyone would even need a tangle-teezer when a denman brush can achieve the same results if you use lighter pressure...but maybe I should try one, a TT that is?And then, there's the old finger combing when my hair is unbearably knotty...in more ways than one!  ;-\"Behave hair, beHAVE!\"  \"Tame the mane!\"But my routine 1x-2x a week is to...1)finger comb - tiny knots/or for just QUICK detangling and then SKIPPING steps 2-4!2)bone comb - regular knots3)denman brush - brush out loose, dead hair; stimulate scalp.4)regular sized bone comb (wider space between teeth w/ bigger teeth) - comb all hair in the style/direction that I  want it to dry in.Not all curly hair is created equal...nor are all knots.

I looked at the otterbox case but it got pretty awful reviews so I ended up getting this one instead. It turned out to be a great purchase. It only took me a minute or two to put it on and it holds together very well. There's some slight squeaking of the plastic along the right side in one area on mine that occurs whenever you pick the iPad up but it doesn't really bother me. The only downside of this case, which some of the other reviews have pointed out, is that the silicon part covering the home button sticks occasionally. In order to make it click the actual home button again you have to pry that silicon piece up and then gently push it back in. Overall this isn't that big of a deal for me because it only sticks every now and again and it takes a whole of half a second to fix it but it is a slightly annoying occurrence for such an expensive case. It does add substantial weight but that kind of goes with this kind of case's territory. Even with its few problems it gives me piece of mind about potentially dropping it (even though I haven't do to the grippy covering) which is all I really wanted in an iPad case.Also, A+ for Gumdrop customer service. I sent them an email about the home button sticking and 10 minutes later they emailed me back. They're releasing a version 2 of this case that fixes the home button sticking issue, (on August 28th I believe),  and are sending me one to replace the one I have.</td><td>1311292800</td><td>Gumdrop Cases Drop Tech Series Case for Apple iPad 2- Black-Black</td><td>A15BCIDJNLIALL</td></tr><tr><td>B003BQ6QXK</td><td>ToiletTree Products</td><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/411rroTN2FL._SY300_.jpg</td><td>29.95</td><td>4.0</td><td>A little annoying to install at first but worth the time.You do have to fill with water for each use and then dump out the water but it works great.</td><td>1359244800</td><td>Fogless Shower Mirror with Squeegee by ToiletTree Products.

It tells you if there is a newer version available for download and allows you to do that if you desire.  It talks about version numbers, but of course if you do not have anything installed yet you don't know what version you have in your CD drive.  Printed on the CD it tells you it's Version 5 but only that is has SP4  (service pack 4) and not the full numeric version that the web site gives you.Go clear to the bottom of the drop down list and you'll see \"no software installed yet\" to get full versionNo real problem, but can cause you to waste some time double checking to avoid mistakes etc.They also want you to set up an account and register the scanner before you can enter the product code supplied with download.This seems like it will be a very good system to use from input to lookup/print/export.  You can select several different formats for reports to print and/or save.Smooth and quiet scanning using only USB power so no AC adapter to fool with.

I was disappointed in the return policy since it was bought before her BD and now I can't return it so she has to use it without the headset I purchased specifically for it in pink !!!!  I tried other headsets on it to make sure it wasn't the cute headset and none of the other headsets work on it that work on the other portable DVD players but the cute pink headset works on the other potable DVD players so it is for sure the DVD player itself that does not work for the headsets.  So I bought a DVD player and headset and can't use that part and can't return it since it was a BD present given to her after the return date expired.

Now you get the pleasure of separating whatever it was ... try that with finish nails ... aaarrgghh.That said, after searching and coming to the point of giving up, I'm actually planning to find my round-to-it and, one of these days dump everything out, then get some darned glue and put those things in permanently.
